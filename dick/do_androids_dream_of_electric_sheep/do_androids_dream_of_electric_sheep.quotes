776	847	848	848	She	287	" and naturally I had turned on Buster Friendly and His Friendly Friends and he was talking about a big news item he 's about to break and then that awful commercial came on , the one I hate ; you know , for Mountibank Lead Codpieces .

My first reaction consisted of being grateful that we could afford a Penfield mood organ . But then I read how unhealthy it was , sensing the absence of life , not just in this building but everywhere , and not reacting - do you see ? I guess you do n't . But that used to be considered a sign of mental illness ; they called it ' absence of appropriate affect . ' So I left the TV sound off and I sat down at my mood organ and I experimented . And I finally found a setting for despair . "
1106	1152	1099	1099	she	292	" So I put it on my schedule for twice a month ; I think that 's a reasonable amount of time to feel hopeless about everything , about staying here on Earth after everybody who 's small has emigrated , do n't you think ? "

1164	1192	1161	1161	Rick	95	" you 're apt to stay in it , not dial your way out . Despair like that , about total reality , is self - perpetuating . "

1279	1374	1258	1258	he	95	" even with an automatic cutoff it 's dangerous to undergo a depression , any kind . Forget what you 've scheduled and I 'll forget what I 've scheduled ; we 'll dial a 104 together and both experience it , and then you stay in it while I reset mine for my usual businesslike attitude . That way I 'll want to hop up to the roof and check out the sheep and then head for the office ; meanwhile I 'll know you 're not sitting here brooding with no TV . "

If I do n't want to dial , I do n't want to dial that most of all , because then I will want to dial , and wanting to dial is right now the most alien drive I can imagine ; I just want to sit here on the bed and stare at the floor .

1720	1797	1670	1670	Iran	96	" I 'll dial for both of us , Rick said , and led her back into the bedroom . There , at her console , he dialed 594 : pleased acknowledgment of husband 's superior wisdom in all matters . On his own console he dialed for a creative and fresh attitude toward his job , although this he hardly needed ; such was his habitual , innate approach without recourse to Penfield artificial brain stimulation .

2591	2663	2588	2588	Barbour	98	" How do you mean ? A lot of people have two animals , even three , four , and like in the case of Fred Washborne , who owns the algae - processing plant my brother works at , even five .

2826	2876	2823	2823	Barbour	98	" Deckard , you do n't understand about horses ; there 's a reason why Sidney 's does n't have any Percheron colts in stock . Percheron colts just do n't change hands - at catalogue value , even . They 're too scarce , even relatively inferior ones . "
2886	2971	2877	2877	He	95	" I 've had Judy for three years and not in all that time have I seen a Percheron mare of her quality . To acquire her I had to fly to Canada , and I personally drove her back here myself to make sure she was n't stolen .

Then somewhere I could find , from someone , what I want . Even if the listing in Sidney 's Animal & Fowl is in italics . Five thousand dollars - but , he thought , the five andys first have to make their way to Earth from one of the colony planets ; I ca n't control that , I ca n't make five of them come here , and even if I could there are other bounty hunters with other police agencies throughout the world . The andys would specifically have to take up residence in Northern California , and the senior bounty hunter in this area , Dave Holden , would have to die or retire . "

10794	10806	10790	10791	the man	320	" This is Deckard . How much is an electric ostrich ? "
10807	10849	10790	10791	the man	320	" Oh , I 'd say we could fix you up for less than eight hundred dollars . How soon did you want delivery ? We would have to make it up for you ; there 's not that much call for- "
10850	10858	10859	10859	Rick	95	" I 'll talk to you later , "
10875	10880	10881	10881	He	95	" Good - by . "
11068	11082	11083	11084	Inspector Bryant	119	" I see you brought the poop sheet on that new brain unit , "
11095	11118	11092	11092	Rick	95	" Yeah , I heard about it on the grapevine . How many andys are involved and how far did Dave get ? "
11119	11125	11126	11126	Bryant	119	" Eight to start with , "
11133	11140	11126	11126	Bryant	119	" Dave got the first two . "
11141	11152	11092	11092	Rick	95	" And the remaining six are here in Northern California ? "
11153	11191	11192	11192	Bryant	119	" As far as we know . Dave thinks so . That was him I was talking to . I have his notes ; they were in his desk . He says all he knows is here . "
11239	11248	11249	11249	Rick	95	" I have nothing on I my agenda , "
11252	11264	11265	11265	Bryant	119	" I 'm ready to take over in Dave 's place . "
11269	11327	11328	11328	He	119	" Dave used the Voigt - Kampff Altered Scale in testing out the individuals he suspected . You realize - you ought to , anyhow - that this test is n't specific for the new brain units . No test is ; the Voigt scale , altered three years ago by Kampff , is all we have . "
11333	11357	11328	11328	He	119	" Dave considered it accurate . Maybe it is . But I would suggest this , before you take out after these six . "
11366	11392	11359	11359	he	119	" Fly to Seattle and talk with the Rosen people . Have them supply you a representative sampling of types employing the new Nexus-6 unit . "
11393	11403	11404	11404	Rick	95	" And put them through the Voigt - Kampff , "
11407	11413	11404	11404	Rick	95	" It sounds so easy , "
11421	11424	11425	11425	Bryant	119	" Pardon ? "
11428	11447	11425	11425	Bryant	119	" I think I 'll talk to the Rosen organization myself , while you 're on your way . "
11475	11527	11528	11528	He	119	" I 'm going to discuss with them the possibility of including several humans , as well as their new androids . But you wo n't know . It 'll be my decision , in conjunction with the manufacturers . It should be set up by the time you get there . "
11538	11567	11528	11528	He	119	" This is the first time you 'll be acting as senior bounty bunter . Dave knows a lot ; he 's got years of experience behind him . "
11568	11573	11574	11574	Rick	95	" So have I , "
11578	11633	11634	11634	Bryant	119	" You 've handled assignments devolving to you from Dave 's schedule ; he 's always decided exactly which ones to turn over to you and which not to . But now you 've got six that he intended to retire himself - one of which managed to get him first . This one . "
11645	11649	11650	11650	Bryant	119	" Max Polokov , "
11653	11720	11650	11650	Bryant	119	" That 's what it calls itself , anyhow . Assuming Dave was right . Everything is based on that assumption , this entire list . And yet the Voigt - Kampff Altered Scale has only been administered to the first three , the two Dave retired and then Polokov . It was while Dave was administering the test ; that 's when Polokov lasered him . "
11721	11729	11730	11730	Rick	95	" Which proves that Dave was right , "
11747	11754	11755	11755	Bryant	119	" You get started for Seattle , "
11758	11772	11755	11755	Bryant	119	" Do n't tell them first ; I 'll handle it . Listen . "
11783	11804	11773	11773	He	119	" When you run the Voigt - Kampff scale up there , if one of the humans fails to pass it- "
11805	11811	11812	11812	Rick	95	" That ca n't happen , "
11815	11936	11937	11937	Rick	95	" One day , a few weeks ago , I talked with Dave about exactly that . He had been thinking along the same lines . I had a memo from the Soviet police , W.P.O. itself , circulated throughout Earth plus the colonies . A group of psychiatrists in Leningrad have approached W.P.O. with the following proposition . They want the latest and most accurate personality profile analytical tools used in determining the presence of an android - in other words the Voigt - Kampff scaleapplied to a carefully selected group of schizoid and schizophrenic human patients . Those , specifically , which reveal what 's called a ' flattening of affect . ' You 've heard of that . "
11940	11949	11937	11937	Rick	95	" That 's specifically what the scale measures . "
11950	11960	11773	11773	He	119	" Then you understand what they 're worried about . "
11961	12023	11937	11937	Rick	95	" This problem has always existed . Since we first encountered androids posing as humans . The consensus of police opinion is known to you in Lurie Kampff s article , written eight years ago . Role - taking Blockage in the Undeteriorated Schizophrenic . Kampff compared the diminished emphatic faculty found in human mental patients and a superficially similar but basically- "
12024	12029	12030	12030	Bryant	119	" The Leningrad psychiatrists , "
12035	12083	12084	12084	He	119	" think that a small class of human beings could not pass the Voigt - Kampff scale . If you tested them in line with police work you 'd assess them as humanoid robots . You 'd be wrong , but by then they 'd be dead . "
12096	12101	12102	12102	Rick	95	" But these individuals , "
12105	12109	12102	12102	Rick	95	" would all be- "
12110	12117	12118	12118	Bryant	119	" They 'd be in institutions , "
12121	12166	12118	12118	Bryant	119	" They could n't conceivably function in the outside world ; they certainly could n't go undetected as advanced psychotics - unless of course their breakdown had come recently and suddenly and no one had gotten around to noticing . But this could happen . "
12167	12174	12175	12175	Rick	95	" A million to one odds , "
12184	12189	12190	12190	Bryant	119	" What worried Dave , "
12193	12318	12190	12190	Bryant	119	" is this appearance of the new Nexus-6 advance type . The Rosen organization assured us , as you know , that a Nexus-6 could be delineated by standard profile tests . We took their word for it . Now we 're forced , as we knew we would be , to determine it on our own . That 's what you 'll be doing in Seattle . You understand , do n't you that this could go wrong either way . If you ca n't pick out all the humanoid robots , then we have no reliable analytical tool and we 'll never find the ones who 're already escaping . If your scale factors out a human subject , identifies him as android- "
12325	12398	12399	12399	He	614	" It would be awkward , although no one , absolutely not the Rosen people , will make the news public . Actually we 'll be able to sit on it indefinitely , although of course we 'll have to inform W.P.O. and they in turn will notify Leningrad . Eventually it 'll pop out of the ' papes at us . But by then we may have developed a better scale . "
12405	12423	12399	12399	He	614	" You want to get started ? Use a department car and fuel yourself at our pumps . "
12429	12449	12450	12450	Bryant	119	" Can I take Dave Holden 's notes with me ? I want to read them along the way . "
12453	12467	12450	12450	Bryant	119	" Let 's wait until you 've tried out your scale in Seattle . "
12555	12561	12562	12562	Rick	95	" What 's the matter ? "
12578	12603	12572	12573	The girl	620	" Oh , I do n't know . Something about the way we got talked to on the phone . It does n't matter . "
12616	12629	12605	12605	she	617	" I 'm Rachael Rosen . I guess you 're Mr. Deckard . "
12630	12637	12638	12638	he	614	" This is not my idea , "
12641	12673	12674	12674	She	617	" Yes , Inspector Bryant told us that . But you 're officially the San Francisco Police Department , and it does n't believe our unit is to the public benefit . "
12689	12721	12686	12686	Rick	95	" A humanoid robot is like any other machine ; it can fluctuate between being a benefit and a hazard very rapidly . As a benefit it 's not our problem . "
12722	12728	12774	12775	the girl	620	" But as a hazard , "
12733	12753	12729	12730	Rachael Rosen	137	" then you come in . Is it true , Mr. Deckard , that you 're a bounty hunter ? "
12762	12773	12774	12775	the girl	620	" You have no difficulty viewing an android as inert , "
12778	12791	12774	12775	the girl	620	" So you can ' retire ' it , as they say . "
12792	12803	12804	12804	he	614	" Do you have the group selected out for me ? "
12807	12812	12804	12804	he	614	" I 'd like to- "
13040	13046	13047	13048	the girl	620	" His name is Bill , "
13054	13070	13071	13071	She	620	" Bill the raccoon . We acquired him just last year from a subsidiary corporation . "
13129	13136	13137	13137	he	614	" A major manufacturer of androids , "
13141	13150	13137	13137	he	614	" invests its surplus capital on living animals . "
13151	13157	13158	13159	Rachael Rosen	137	" Look at the owl , "
13162	13173	13174	13174	She	620	" Here , I 'll wake it up for you . "
13285	13290	13291	13291	he	614	" It 's artificial , "
13306	13309	13291	13291	he	614	" No . "
13332	13338	13339	13339	he	614	" But Sidney 's listing , "
13359	13389	13390	13390	She	620	" We do n't buy from Sidney 's or from any animal dealer . All our purchases are from private parties and the prices we pay are n't reported . "
13393	13436	13355	13356	The girl	620	" Also we have our own naturalists ; they 're now working up in Canada . There 's still a good deal of forest left , comparatively speaking , anyhow . Enough for small animals and once in a while a bird . "
13665	13672	13673	13673	he	614	" If you sold your owl , "
13681	13697	13673	13673	he	614	" how much would you want for it , and how much of that down ? "
13698	13706	13707	13707	She	642	" We would never sell our owl . "
13725	13751	13722	13722	her	642	" And even if we sold it , you could n't possibly pay the price . What kind of animal do you have at home ? "
13752	13756	13757	13757	he	614	" A sheep , "
13760	13768	13757	13757	he	614	" A black - faced Suffolk ewe . "
13769	13778	13722	13722	her	642	" Well , then you should be happy . "
13779	13784	13785	13785	he	614	" I 'm happy , "
13788	13807	13808	13808	He	614	" It 's just that I always wanted an owl , even back before they all dropped dead . "
13812	13817	13818	13818	Rachael	137	" All but yours . "
13821	13843	13844	13844	She	137	" Our present crash program and overall planning call for us to obtain an additional owl which can nate with Scrappy . "
13917	13934	13876	13876	Its	643	" I 'd like to test out the selection , now . Can we go downstairs ? "
13935	13950	13876	13876	Its	643	" My uncle took the call from your superior and by now he probably has- "
13951	13957	13958	13958	Rick	95	" You 're a family ? "
13962	13972	13958	13958	Rick	95	" A corporation this large is a family affair ? "
13980	14002	14003	14003	She	137	" Uncle Eldon should have an android group and a control group set up by now . So let 's go . "
14044	14052	14053	14053	he	95	" What have you got against me ? "
14074	14077	14078	14078	she	137	" Well , "
14081	14101	14078	14078	she	137	" you , a little police department employee , are in a unique position . Know what I mean ? "
14112	14120	14121	14121	he	95	" How much of your current output , "
14124	14133	14121	14121	he	95	" consists of types equipped with the Nexus-6 ? "
14134	14137	14138	14138	Rachael	137	" All , "
14141	14155	14138	14138	Rachael	137	" I 'm sure the Voigt - Kampff scale will work with them . "
14156	14174	14175	14175	Her	137	" And if it does n't we 'll have to withdraw all Nexus-6 types from the market . "
14196	14220	14181	14181	she	137	" Because you police departments ca n't do an adequate job in the simple matter of detecting the minuscule number of Nexus-6s who balk- "
14254	14260	14261	14261	he	647	" I 'm Eldon Rosen , "
14270	14329	14330	14330	His	647	" Listen , Deckard ; you realize we do n't manufacture anything here on Earth , right ? We ca n't just phone down to production and ask for a diverse flock of items ; it 's not that we do n't want or intend to cooperate with you . Anyhow I 've done the best I can . "
14350	14551	14347	14347	Rick	95	" I 'm ready to start . The senior Rosen 's nervousness buoyed up his own confidence . They 're afraid of me , he realized with a start . Rachael Rosen included . I can probably force them to abandon manufacture of their Nexus-6 types ; what I do during the next hour will affect the structure of their operation . It could conceivably determine the future of the Rosen Association , here in the United States , in Russia , and on Mars . The two members of the Rosen family studied him apprehensively and he felt the hollowness of their manner ; by coming here he had brought the void to them , had ushered in emptiness and the hush of economic death . They control inordinate power , he thought . This enterprise is considered one of the system 's industrial pivots ; the manufacture of androids , in fact , has become so linked to the colonization effort that if one dropped into ruin , so would the other in time . The Rosen Association , naturally , understood this perfectly . Eldon Rosen had obviously been conscious of it since Harry Bryant 's call . "
14561	14616	14559	14559	you	649	" Rick said as the two Rosens led him down a highly illuminated wide corridor . He himself felt quietly content . This moment , more than any other which he could remember , pleased him . Well , they would all soon know what his testing apparatus could accomplish - and could not . "
14629	14634	14559	14559	you	649	" he pointed out , "
14661	14754	14559	14559	you	649	" The Rosens had steered him from the corridor and into a chic , living roomish cubicle furnished with carpeting , lamps , couch , and modern little end - tables on which rested recent magazines ... including , he noticed , the February supplement to the Sidney 's catalogue , which he personally had not seen . In fact , the February supplement would n't be out for another three days . Obviously the Rosen Association had a special relationship with Sidney 's . Annoyed , he picked up the supplement . "
14772	14798	14799	14799	I	0	" As a matter of fact this might violate a federal statute ; he tried to remember the relevant law , found he could not . "
14806	14832	14799	14799	I	0	" he said , and , opening his briefcase , dropped the supplement within . After an interval of silence , Eldon Rosen said wearily , "
14846	14847	14835	14835	officer	652	" "
14855	14859	14860	14860	I	0	" Rick said . "
14866	14899	14862	14864	a bounty hunter	1909	" From his opened briefcase he fished out the Voigt - Kampff apparatus , seated himself at a nearby rosewood coffee table , and began to assemble the rather simple polygraphic instruments . "
14908	14922	14923	14923	I	0	" he informed Eldon Rosen , who now looked more haggard than ever . "
14929	14937	14923	14923	I	0	" Rachael said , also seating herself . "
14957	14961	14952	14952	you	652	" Rick said , "

15026	15040	15083	15083	They	658	" He showed her the other instrument , a pencil - beam light . "
15067	15068	15083	15083	They	658	" "
15078	15082	15076	15076	androids	657	" Rachael said . "
15102	15106	15083	15083	They	658	" Rachael said , "

15116	15130	15131	15131	We	653	" Rick said , puzzled . Speaking up , Eldon Rosen said hoarsely , "
15152	15173	15148	15148	you	652	" He seated himself in a series of clumsy motions , got out a cigarette , lit it and fixedly watched .
15229	15262	15225	15226	Rick Deckard	95	" I 'm going to outline a number of social situations . You are to express your reaction to each as quickly as possible . You will be timed , of course . "
15263	15268	15269	15269	Rachael	137	" And of course , "
15273	15310	15311	15311	She	137	" my verbal responses wo n't count . It 's solely the eye - muscle and capillary reaction that you 'll use as indices . But I 'll answer ; I want to go through this and- "
15315	15322	15323	15323	Rick	95	" Go ahead , Mr. Deckard . "
15331	15342	15323	15323	Rick	95	" You are given a calfskin wallet on your birthday . "
15363	15370	15371	15371	Rachael	137	" I would n't accept it , "
15374	15390	15371	15371	Rachael	137	" Also I 'd report the person who gave it to me to the police . "
15413	15432	15397	15397	Rick	95	" You have a little boy and he shows you his butterfly collection , including his killing jar . "
15433	15442	15443	15443	Rachael	137	" I 'd take him to the doctor . "
15473	15480	15481	15481	he	95	" You 're sitting watching TV , "
15484	15496	15481	15481	he	95	" and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist . "
15500	15506	15497	15497	Rachael	137	" I 'd kill it . "
15535	15553	15554	15554	He	95	" In a magazine you come across a full - page color picture of a nude girl . "
15557	15567	15554	15554	He	95	" Is this testing whether I 'm an android , "
15572	15579	15554	15554	He	95	" or whether I 'm homosexual ? "
15589	15596	15586	15586	He	95	" Your husband likes the picture . "
15606	15610	15611	15611	he	95	" The girl , "
15614	15627	15611	15611	he	95	" is lying face down on a large and beautiful bearskin rug . "
15666	15680	15681	15681	he	95	" Your husband hangs the picture up on the wall of his study , "
15691	15699	15700	15700	Rachael	137	" I certainly would n't let him , "
15703	15706	15707	15707	he	95	" Okay , "
15712	15774	15707	15707	he	95	" Now consider this . You 're reading a novel written in the old days before the war . The characters are visiting Fisherman 's Wharf in San Francisco . They become hungry and enter a seafood restaurant . One of them orders lobster , and the chef drops the lobster into the tub of boiling water while the characters watch . "
15775	15779	15780	15780	Rachael	137	" Oh god , "
15783	15804	15780	15780	Rachael	137	" That 's awful ! Did they really do that ? It 's depraved ! You mean a live lobster ? "
15823	15830	15831	15831	he	95	" You rent a mountain cabin , "
15834	15851	15831	15831	he	95	" in an area still verdant . It 's rustic knotty pine with a huge fireplace . "

15862	15910	15856	15856	Rachael	137	" On the walls someone has hung old maps , Currier and Ives prints , and above the fireplace a deer 's head has been mounted , a full stag with developed horns . The people with you admire the decor of the cabin and you all decide- "
15911	15918	15919	15919	Rachael	137	" Not with the deer head , "
15935	15940	15941	15941	Rick	95	" You become pregnant , "
15944	15972	15941	15941	Rick	95	" by a man who has promised to marry you . The man goes off with another woman , your best friend ; you get an abortion and- "
15973	15981	15982	15982	Rachael	137	" I would never get an abortion , "
15985	16003	15982	15982	Rachael	137	" Anyhow you ca n't . It 's a life sentence and the police are always watching . "
16014	16021	16022	16022	Rick	95	" How do you know that ? "
16028	16037	16022	16022	Rick	95	" About the difficulty of obtaining an abortion ? "
16038	16043	16044	16044	Rachael	137	" Everybody knows that , "
16047	16057	16059	16059	He	95	" It sounded like you spoke from personal experience . "
16076	16149	16150	16150	Rachael	137	" One more . You 're dating a man and he asks you to visit his apartment . While you 're there he offers you a drink . As you stand holding your glass you see into the bedroom ; it 's attractively decorated with bullfight posters , and you wander in to look closer . He follows after you , closing the door . Putting his arm around you , he says- "
16153	16160	16150	16150	Rachael	137	" What 's a bullfight poster ? "
16161	16185	16186	16186	He	662	" Drawings , usually in color and very large , showing a matador with his cape , a bull trying to gore him . "
16190	16196	16197	16197	he	662	" How old are you ? "
16206	16211	16212	16212	Rachael	137	" I 'm eighteen , "
16215	16236	16212	16212	Rachael	137	" Okay ; so this man closes the door and puts his arm around me . What does he say ? "
16240	16248	16237	16237	Rick	95	" Do you know how bullfights ended ; "
16249	16256	16269	16269	He	662	" I suppose somebody got hurt . "
16257	16268	16269	16269	He	662	" The bull at the end , was always killed . "
16290	16295	16296	16296	he	662	" A final question , "
16299	16334	16296	16296	he	662	" Two - part . You are watching an old movie on TV , a movie from before the war . It shows a banquet in progress ; the guests are enjoying raw oysters . "
16335	16338	16339	16339	Rachael	137	" Ugh , "
16347	16351	16352	16352	he	662	" The entree , "
16355	16365	16352	16352	he	662	" consists of boiled dog , stuffed with rice . "
16382	16400	16401	16401	He	662	" Are raw oysters more acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog ? Evidently not . "
16422	16428	16429	16429	he	662	" You 're an android , "
16432	16441	16442	16442	he	662	" That 's the conclusion of the testing , "
16474	16483	16484	16484	Rick	95	" I 'm right , are n't I ? "
16498	16501	16502	16502	he	662	" Look , "
16506	16536	16502	16502	he	662	" We have no conflict of interest ; it 's important to me that the Voigt - Kampff test functions , almost as important as it is to you . "
16542	16549	16502	16502	he	662	" She 's not an android . "
16550	16557	16558	16558	Rick	95	" I do n't believe it , "
16561	16567	16568	16568	Rachael	137	" Why would he lie ? "
16574	16585	16568	16568	Rachael	137	" If anything , we 'd lie the other way . "
16586	16597	16598	16598	Rick	95	" I want a bone marrow analysis made of you , "
16603	16626	16598	16598	Rick	95	" It can eventually be organically determined whether you 're android or not ; it 's slow and painful , admittedly , but- "
16627	16630	16631	16631	Rachael	137	" Legally , "
16634	16735	16736	16736	She	137	" I ca n't be forced to undergo a bone marrow test . That 's been established in the courts ; self - incrimination . And anyhow on a live person - not the corpse of a retired android - it takes a long time . You can give that damn Voigt - Kampff profile test because of the specials ; they have to be tested for constantly , and while the government was doing that you police agencies slipped the Voigt - Kampff through . But what you said is true ; that 's the end of the testing . "
16761	16774	16750	16750	her	137	" The issue is not the legality of the bone marrow analysis , "
16780	16814	16775	16776	Eldon Rosen	139	" The issue is that your empathy delineation test failed in response to my niece . I can explain why she scored as an android might . Rachael grew up aboard Salander 3 . She
16880	16881	16882	16882	You	673	" "
16888	16895	16882	16882	You	673	" Rachael said over her shoulder . "
16968	16969	16971	16971	androids	657	" "
16973	16978	16971	16971	androids	657	" Eldon Rosen added . "
17004	17005	17006	17006	I	0	" "
17013	17017	17006	17006	I	0	" Rick said . "
17054	17063	17066	17066	your	0	" That , anyhow , was the idea . "
17069	17074	17066	17066	your	0	" Eldon Rosen asked , "
17085	17086	17076	17076	you	0	" "
17093	17110	17076	17076	you	0	" He began restoring his testing gear to his briefcase ; the two Rosens watched silently . "
17113	17117	17076	17076	you	0	" he added , "
17144	17151	17152	17152	We	689	" He snapped the briefcase shut . "
17158	17162	17152	17152	We	689	" Rachael said . "
17184	17189	17152	17152	We	689	" She gestured vigorously . "
17207	17211	17212	17212	I	0	" Rick said , "
17245	17283	17288	17288	you	0	" And I can see now , he realized , that I would n't have gotten it . Bryant was right . Thank god I did n't go out bounty hunting on the basis of this test . "
17294	17307	17288	17288	you	0	" Eldon Rosen said . He glanced at Rachael , who nodded . "
17313	17322	17308	17308	We	689	" Eldon said , then , with reluctance . "
17326	17330	17334	17334	your	0	" Rick said , "
17357	17358	17359	17359	We	689	" "
17366	17371	17359	17359	We	689	" Eldon Rosen said . "
17464	17474	17475	17475	Your	0	" His voice had become hard and bitingly penetrating . "
17521	17522	17517	17517	Ours	703	" "
17527	17533	17517	17517	Ours	703	" Rick said with acuity , "
17560	17593	17550	17550	You	704	" And my test , he realized , is wiped out . I should n't have gone for it , he said to himself . However , it 's too late now . "
17601	17621	17598	17599	Mr. Deckard	121	" Rachael Rosen agreed in a quiet , reasonable voice ; she turned toward him , then , and smiled .
17708	17714	17715	17716	Eldon Rosen	139	" Your superior Mr. Bryant , "
17719	17739	17740	17740	He	139	" will have difficulty understanding how you happened to let us void your testing apparatus before the test began . "
17765	17777	17778	17778	Eldon	139	" I think the right thing for us all to do , "
17781	17786	17787	17787	He	139	" is sit down and- "
17791	17834	17787	17787	He	139	" We can work something out , Mr. Deckard . There 's no need for anxiety . The Nexus-6 variety of android is a fact ; we here at the Rosen Association recognize it and I think now you do , too . "
17853	17864	17869	17869	she	137	" I doubt if I 'll ever own an owl . "
17925	17930	17931	17932	Eldon Rosen	139	" But an owl , "
17935	17942	17931	17932	Eldon Rosen	139	" is the thing you want . "
17950	17959	17943	17943	He	139	" I do n't think he has any idea- "
17960	17966	17967	17967	Rachael	137	" Of course he does , "
17970	17986	17967	17967	Rachael	137	" He knows exactly where this is heading . Do n't you , Mr. Deckard ? "
18011	18026	17988	17988	she	137	" You 're practically there , Mr. Deckard . You practically have your owl . "
18033	18063	18030	18030	she	137	" He 's a bounty hunter ; remember ? So he lives off the bounty he makes , not his salary . Is n't that so , Mr. Deckard ? "
18067	18075	18076	18076	Rachael	137	" How many androids escaped this time ? "
18083	18101	18080	18080	he	139	" Eight . Originally . Two have already been retired , by someone else ; not me . "
18102	18111	18112	18112	Rachael	137	" You get how much for each android ? "
18120	18124	18117	18117	he	139	" It varies . "
18128	18181	18117	18117	he	139	" If you have no test you can administer , then there is no way you can identify an android . And if there 's no way you can identify an android there 's no way you can collect your bounty . So if the Voigt - Kampff scale has to be abandoned- "
18182	18187	18188	18188	Rick	95	" A new scale , "
18191	18201	18188	18188	Rick	95	" will replace it . This has happened before . "
18235	18250	18251	18251	Rachael	137	" Eventually , of course , the Voigt - Kampff scale will become obsolete , "
18254	18288	18251	18251	Rachael	137	" But not now . We 're satisfied ourselves that it will delineate the Nexus-6 types and we 'd like you to proceed on that basis in your own particular , peculiar work . "
18311	18320	18299	18299	she	137	" Tell him he can have his owl , "
18325	18332	18333	18333	Rachael	137	" You can have the owl , "
18340	18381	18382	18382	Rick	95	" The one up on the roof . Scrappy . But we will want to mate it if we can get our hands on a male . And any offspring will be ours ; that has to be absolutely understood . "
18385	18392	18382	18382	Rick	95	" I 'll divide the brood . "
18393	18396	18397	18397	Rachael	137	" No , "
18413	18457	18406	18406	his	139	" That way you 'd have claim to the sole bloodline of owls for the rest of eternity . And there 's another condition . You ca n't will your owl to anybody ; at your death it reverts back to the association . "
18458	18462	18463	18463	Rick	95	" That sounds , "
18466	18498	18463	18463	Rick	95	" like an invitation for you to come in and kill me . To get your owl back immediately . I wo n't agree to that ; it 's too dangerous . "
18499	18506	18507	18507	Rachael	137	" You 're a bounty hunter , "
18510	18560	18507	18507	Rachael	137	" You can handle a laser gun - in fact you 're carrying one right now . If you ca n't protect yourself , how are you going to retire the six remaining Nexus-6 andys ? They 're a good deal smarter than the Grozzi Corporation 's old W-4 . "
18561	18567	18568	18568	he	95	" But I hunt them , "
18571	18589	18568	18568	he	95	" This way , with a reversion clause on the owl , someone would be hunting me . "
18623	18704	18620	18620	Rachael	137	" All right ; we 'll yield on that . You can will the owl to your heirs . But we insist on getting the complete brood . If you ca n't agree to that , go on back to San Francisco and admit to your superiors in the department that the Voigt - Kampff scale , at least as administered by you , ca n't distinguish an andy from a human being . And then look for another job . "
18705	18711	18712	18712	Rick	95	" Give me some time , "
18715	18718	18719	18719	Rachael	137	" Okay , "
18722	18735	18736	18736	She	137	" We 'll leave you in here , where it 's comfortable . "
18741	18746	18747	18748	Eldon Rosen	139	" Half an hour , "
18800	18843	18796	18796	Rick	95	" You managed to set me up perfectly . You have it on tape that I missed on you ; you know that my job depends on the use of the Voigt - Kampff scale ; and you own that goddamn owl . "
18844	18850	18851	18851	Rachael	137	" Your owl , dear , "
18854	18886	18851	18851	Rachael	137	" Remember ? We 'll tie your home address around its leg and have it fly down to San Francisco ; it 'll meet you there when you get off work . "
18902	18907	18908	18908	he	95	" Just a second , "
18919	18924	18916	18916	Rachael	137	" You 've decided ? "
18925	18929	18930	18930	he	95	" I want , "
18937	18953	18930	18930	he	95	" to ask you one more question from the VoigtKampff scale . Sit down again . "
18972	18978	18979	18979	she	137	" What 's this for ? "
19039	19043	19044	19044	Rick	95	" My briefcase , "
19056	19066	19047	19047	he	95	" Nice , is n't it ? Department issue . "
19067	19072	19073	19073	Rachael	137	" Well , well , "
19077	19080	19081	19081	Rick	95	" Babyhide , "
19094	19102	19084	19084	He	95	" One hundred percent genuine human babyhide . "
19151	19157	19158	19158	he	95	" Thanks , Miss Rosen , "
19174	19179	19158	19158	he	95	" That 's all . "
19180	19185	19186	19186	Rachael	137	" You 're leaving ? "
19189	19192	19193	19193	he	95	" Yes , "
19196	19201	19193	19193	he	95	" I 'm satisfied . "
19207	19215	19204	19204	Rachael	137	" What about the other nine subjects ? "
19216	19226	19227	19227	he	95	" The scale has been adequate in your case , "
19230	19243	19227	19227	he	95	" I can extrapolate from that ; it 's clearly still effective . "
19261	19266	19258	19258	he	95	" Does she know ? "
19299	19316	19295	19296	Eldon Rosen	139	" No . We programmed her completely . But I think toward the end she suspected . "
19323	19334	19335	19335	Pale	146	" You guessed when he asked for one more try . "
19341	19349	19353	19353	her	620	" Do n't be afraid of him , "
19355	19384	19385	19385	He	139	" You 're not an escaped android on Earth illegally ; you 're the property of the Rosen Association , used as a sales device for prospective emigrants . "
19406	19411	19412	19412	Rick	95	" He 's right , "
19415	19430	19431	19431	He	139	" I 'm not going to retire you , Miss Rosen . Good day . "
19449	19455	19446	19446	he	139	" is the owl genuine ? "
19464	19470	19471	19472	Eldon Rosen	139	" He 's leaving anyhow , "
19475	19491	19471	19472	Eldon Rosen	139	" It does n't matter ; the owl is artificial . There are no owls . "
19492	19495	19496	19496	Rick	95	" Hmm , "
19733	19844	19720	19721	Buster Friendly	97	" -ho ho , folks ! Zip click zip ! Time for a brief note on tomorrow 's weather ; first the Eastern seaboard of the U.S.A. Mongoose satellite reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward noon and then will taper off . So all you dear folks who 'll be venturing out ought to wait until afternoon , eh ? And speaking of waiting , it 's now only ten hours ' til that big piece of news , my special exposé ! Tell your friends to watch ! I 'm revealing something that 'll amaze you . Now , you might guess that it 's just the usual- "
19935	19938	19939	19939	he	112	" Hey , "
19942	19958	19959	19959	He	112	" I live upstairs . I heard your TV . Let 's meet ; okay ? "
19979	19988	19989	19989	he	112	" I brought you a cube of margarine , "

20678	20685	20686	20686	he	113	" I could help you unpack , "

But eventually I 'll die or go away , and then the kipple will again take over . It 's a universal principle operating throughout the universe ; the entire universe is moving toward a final state of total , absolute kippleization . "

21477	21527	21469	21469	he	0	" is the most personal possession you have ! It 's an extension of your body ; it 's the way you touch other humans , it 's the way you stop being alone . But you know that . Everybody knows that . Mercer even lets people like me- "

21578	21604	21569	21569	he	0	" I 'm not very special , only moderately ; not like some you see . But that 's what Mercer does n't care about . "

21618	21630	21614	21615	the girl	620	" you can count that as a major objection to Mercerism . "

24617	24664	24665	24665	He	115	" Because Wilbur Mercer is always renewed . He 's eternal . At the top of the hill he 's struck down ; he sinks into the tomb world but then he rises inevitably . And us with him . So we 're eternal , too . "
24683	24696	24680	24680	Sloat	115	" Buster is immortal , like Mercer . There 's no difference . "

24880	24897	24898	24898	He	115	" is n't false . I knew sometime this would happen . And it 's dead . "

25107	25111	25112	25112	Isidore	112	" I thought , "
25117	25131	25112	25112	Isidore	112	" it was a really good job . So good it fooled me ; I

25154	25159	25148	25148	Isidore	112	" Milt said mildly . "

25231	25300	25228	25228	Milt	154	" Let the chickenhead off the hook , Han . He 's got a point ; the fakes are beginning to be darn near real , what with those disease circuits they 're building into the new ones . And living animals do die ; that 's one of the risks in owning them . We 're just not used to it because all we see are fakes . "
25301	25306	25307	25307	Sloat	115	" The goddamn waste , "
25310	25317	25307	25307	Sloat	115	" According to M - mercer , "

25355	25366	25367	25368	Mr. Sloat	115	" Tell that to the guy that owned this cat , "
25381	25394	25378	25378	Isidore	112	" You mean I have to ? But you always handle vidcalls . "
25425	25431	25432	25432	Milt	154	" Do n't make him , "
25435	25441	25442	25442	He	154	" I 'll do it . "
25448	25454	25442	25442	He	154	" What 's his number ? "
25455	25463	25464	25464	Isidore	112	" I 've got it here somewhere . "
25475	25484	25472	25472	Sloat	115	" I want the chickenhead to do it . "
25485	25496	25497	25497	Isidore	112	" I c - c - can't use the vidphone , "
25504	25538	25539	25539	Milt	154	" Because I 'm hairy , ugly , dirty , stooped , snaggletoothed , and gray . And also I feel sick from the radiation ; I think I 'm going to die . "
25546	25589	25590	25590	He	154	" I guess if I felt that way I would n't use the vidphone either . Come on , Isidore ; if you do n't give me the owner 's number I ca n't make the call and you 'll have to . "
25597	25603	25604	25604	Sloat	115	" The chickenhead makes it , "
25607	25613	25604	25604	Sloat	115	" or he 's fired . "

25804	25842	25843	25843	Sloat	115	" but he should n't have to . And he 's right ; the dust has affected you ; you 're damn near blind and in a couple of years you wo n't be able to hear . "
25846	25866	25843	25843	Sloat	115	" It 's got to you , too , Borogrove . Your skin is the color of dog manure . "

26275	26322	26264	26265	Mrs. Pilsen	162	" There is only one cat like Horace . He used to - when he was just a kitten - stand and stare up at us as if asking a question . We never understood what the question was . Maybe now he knows the answer . "

26389	26437	26385	26386	Mrs. Pilsen	162	" What are you saying ? Do n't tell my husband that ; do n't suggest that to Ed or he 'll go mad . He loved Horace more than any cat he ever had , and he 's had a cat since he was a child . "

26663	26708	26660	26660	Milt	154	" If that 's what you want . But it 's been our experience that the owner of the animal is never fooled . It 's only casual observers such as neighbors . You see , once you get real close to a false animal- "

29591	29629	29575	29575	them	943	" he said and hung up . What kind of world is it , he asked himself , when an android phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance ? He rang the police operator back . "
29642	29646	29649	29650	Mr. Deckard	121	" he said . "

29970	29977	29978	29978	Rick	95	" How does it differ functionally ? "
29986	29991	30019	30019	he	95	" Press the trigger . "
30024	30029	30030	30030	Kadalyi	168	" The triggering circuit , "
30034	30047	30048	30048	He	168	" is n't attached . It remains with me . You see ? "
30058	30077	30048	30048	He	168	" And I can also direct it , within certain limits . Irrespective of where it 's aimed . "
30078	30088	30089	30089	Rick	95	" You 're not Polokov , you 're Kadalyi , "
30092	30109	30089	30089	Rick	95	" Do n't you mean that the other way around ? You 're a bit confused . "
30110	30128	30129	30129	Rick	95	" I mean you 're Polokov , the android ; you 're not from the Soviet police . "
30146	30155	30129	30129	Rick	95	" Why wo n't my laser tube fire ? "
30181	30186	30187	30187	Rick	95	" A sine wave , "
30190	30204	30187	30187	Rick	95	" That phases out laser emanation and spreads the beam into ordinary light . "

30389	30404	30376	30376	he	95	" ' You got Polokov . ' He 'll understand that , will he ? "
30405	30408	30409	30409	Rick	95	" Yes , "
30603	30609	30593	30593	she	280	" Oh hello , Rick . "
30610	30627	30709	30710	Buster Friendly	97	" What happened to the 594 I dialed for you before I left ? Pleased acknowledgment of- "
30628	30643	30644	30644	Her	280	" I redialed . As soon as you left . What do you want ? "
30654	30702	30644	30644	Her	280	" I 'm so tired and I just have no hope left , of anything . Of our marriage - and you possibly getting killed by one of those andys . Is that what you want to tell me , Rick ? That an andy got you ? "
30730	30733	30734	30734	he	968	" Listen , "
30738	30754	30734	30734	he	968	" Can you hear me ? I 'm on to something . A new type of android
30791	30798	30778	30778	You	280	" Iran stared at him sightlessly . "
30801	30807	30778	30778	You	280	" she said , nodding . "
30814	30845	30808	30808	I	0	" He could tell , now ; her depression this time had become too vast for her even to hear him . For all intents he spoke into a vacuum . "
30852	31192	30846	30846	I	0	" he finished bitterly and slammed the receiver down . Damn her , he said to himself . What good does it do , my risking my life ? She does n't care whether we own an ostrich or not ; nothing penetrates . I wish I had gotten rid of her two years ago when we were considering splitting up . I can still do it , he reminded himself . Broodingly , he leaned down , gathered together on the car floor his crumpled papers , including the info on Luba Luft . No support , he informed himself . Most androids I 've known have more vitality and desire to live than my wife . She has nothing to give me . That made him think of Rachael Rosen again . Her advice to me as to the Nexus-6 mentality , he realized , turned out to be correct . Assuming she does n't want any of the bounty money , maybe I could use her . The encounter with Kadalyi - Polokov had changed his ideas rather massively . Snapping on his hovercar 's engine he whisked nippity - nip up into the sky , heading toward the old War Memorial Opera House , where , according to Dive Holden 's notes , he would find Luba Luft this time of the day . He wondered , now , about her , too . Some female androids seemed to him pretty ; he had found himself physically attracted by several , and it was an odd sensation , knowing intellectually that they were machines but emotionally reacting anyhow . For example Rachael Rosen . No , he decided ; she 's too thin . No real development , especially in the bust . A figure like a child 's , flat and tame . He could do better . How old did the poop sheet say Luba Luft was ? As he drove he hauled out the now wrinkled notes , found her so - called "
31195	31308	30846	30846	I	0	" Twenty - eight , the sheet read . Judged by appearance , which , with andys , was the only useful standard . It 's a good thing I know something about opera , Rick reflected . That 's another advantage I have over Dave ; I 'm more culturally oriented . I 'll try one more andy before I ask Rachael for help , he decided . If Miss Luft proves exceptionally hard - but he had an intuition she would n't . Polokov had been the rough one ; the others , unaware that anyone actively hunted them , would crumble in succession , plugged like a file of ducks .

37100	37147	37097	37097	Rick	95	" I 'm not an android . You can administer the Voigt - Kampff test to me ; I 've taken it before and I do n't mind taking it again . But I know what the results will be . Can I phone my wife ? "
37148	37164	37097	37097	Rick	95	" You 're allowed one call . Would you rather phone her than a lawyer ? "
37165	37172	37173	37173	Rick	95	" I 'll phone my wife , "
37176	37185	37173	37173	Rick	95	" She can get a lawyer for me . "
37200	37208	37209	37209	He	1072	" There 's the vidphone over there . "
37265	37268	37269	37269	she	1066	" Hello , "
37300	37304	37305	37306	the officer	1077	" No luck ? "
37309	37353	37305	37306	the officer	1077	" Well , you can make another call ; we have a liberal policy in that regard . I ca n't offer you the opportunity of calling a bondsman because your offense is unbailable , at present . When you 're arraigned , however- "
37354	37358	37359	37359	Rick	95	" I know , "
37363	37371	37359	37359	Rick	95	" I 'm familiar with police procedure . "
37372	37378	37379	37380	the officer	1077	" Here 's your briefcase , "
37390	37404	37405	37405	He	1077	" Come into my office I 'd like to talk with you further . "
37429	37435	37425	37426	the officer	1077	" My name is Garland . "
37447	37451	37452	37452	Garland	200	" Sit down , "
37475	37482	37483	37483	Garland	200	" This Voigt - Kampff test , "
37490	37497	37483	37483	Garland	200	" He indicated Rick 's briefcase . "
37504	37517	37483	37483	Garland	200	" he filled and lit a pipe , puffed for a moment . "
37527	37528	37483	37483	Garland	200	" "
37535	37539	37483	37483	Garland	200	" Rick said . "
37567	37568	37559	37559	You	95	" "
37588	37609	37559	37559	You	95	" He continued to study Rick intently , his face turgid ; Rick could not fathom what Garland was thinking . "
37615	37619	37559	37559	You	95	" Garland continued , "
37642	37700	37640	37640	me	0	" Rick stared at him , then grabbed for the briefcase . In a moment the carbons lay spread out before him . Garland had told the truth ; Rick examined the sheet . Neither man - or rather neither he nor Garland - spoke for a time and then Garland cleared his throat , coughed nervously . "
37707	37711	37640	37640	me	0	" he said . "
37734	37746	37732	37732	Deckard	95	" He pressed a key on his desk intercom and said , "
37768	37774	37766	37766	you	95	" He released the key . "
37788	37794	37775	37776	Phil Resch	199	" he said to Rick . "
37805	37806	37807	37807	You	95	" "
37816	37820	37807	37807	You	95	" Rick said . "
37854	37861	37813	37813	his	199	" He indicated the smudged carbon . "
37912	37961	37962	37963	Phil Resch	199	" He pushed the page to Rick , who picked it up and glanced over it . The office door opened and a tall fleshless man with hard - etched features , wearing hornrim glasses and a fuzzy Vandyke beard , appeared . Garland rose , indicating Rick . "
37981	37993	37968	37968	You	1094	" As he shook hands with Rick , Phil Resch said , "
38001	38007	37968	37968	You	1094	" Garland answered for Rick . "
38026	38044	38020	38021	This one	2251	" He handed Phil Resch the sheet which Rick had been examining , that with his own description .
38045	38050	38051	38052	Phil Resch	199	" Say , Gar , "
38055	38060	38051	38052	Phil Resch	199	" This is you . "
38061	38066	38067	38067	Garland	200	" There 's more , "
38070	38131	38067	38067	Garland	200	" He 's also got Luba Luft the opera singer there on his list of retirement - assignments , and Polokov . Remember Polokov ? He 's now dead ; this bounty hunter or android or whatever he is got him , and we running a bone marrow test at the lab . To see if there 's any conceivable basis- "
38132	38139	38140	38141	Phil Resch	199	" Polokov I 've talked to , "
38144	38154	38155	38155	He	199	" That big Santa Claus from the Soviet police ? "
38164	38181	38155	38155	He	199	" I think it 's a good idea to run a bone marrow test on him . "
38182	38189	38190	38190	Garland	200	" Why do you say that ? "
38196	38224	38190	38190	Garland	200	" It 's to remove any legal basis on which this man Deckard could claim he had n't killed anyone ; he only ' retired an android . "
38230	38244	38226	38227	Phil Resch	199	" Polokov struck me as cold . Extremely cerebral and calculating ; detached . "
38245	38256	38257	38257	Garland	200	" A lot of the Soviet police are that way , "
38263	38270	38271	38272	Phil Resch	199	" Luba Luft I never met , "
38275	38285	38271	38272	Phil Resch	199	" Although I 've heard records she 's made . "
38291	38298	38288	38288	he	199	" Did you test her out ? "
38299	38304	38305	38305	Rick	95	" I started to , "
38308	38330	38305	38305	Rick	95	" But I could n't get an accurate reading . And she called in a harness bull , which ended it . "
38331	38335	38336	38337	Phil Resch	199	" And Polokov ? "
38340	38351	38336	38337	Phil Resch	199	" I never got a chance to test him either . "
38360	38378	38358	38358	himself	199	" And I assume you have n't had an opportunity to test out Inspector Garland , here . "
38379	38384	38385	38385	Garland	200	" Of course not , "
38403	38410	38394	38394	his	200	" What test do you use ? "
38415	38422	38411	38412	Phil Resch	199	" The Voigt - Kampff scale . "
38423	38431	38435	38435	Garland	200	" Do n't know that particular one . "
38449	38455	38456	38456	he	200	" I 've always said , "
38459	38479	38456	38456	he	200	" that the best place for an android would be with a big police organization such as W.P.O. Ever since I
38519	38533	38456	38456	he	200	" Getting slowly to his feet Inspector Garland faced Phil Resch and said , "
38543	38581	38535	38535	you	199	" A discreet smiled traveled across Phil Resch 's face ; he started to answer , then shrugged . And remained silent . He did not seem afraid of his superior , despite Garland 's palpable wrath . "
38591	38595	38596	38597	This man	1980	" Garland said . "
38720	38721	38711	38711	he	1980	" "
38724	38729	38711	38711	he	1980	" Phil Resch said . "
38732	38750	38711	38711	he	1980	" Garland mimicked , wrathfully . He looked , now , as if he bordered on apoplexy . "
38759	38770	38754	38754	you	0	" The intercom came on and a female voice said , "
38785	38786	38787	38787	I	0	" "
38794	38817	38787	38787	I	0	" Phil Resch said . Garland glanced at him , seething . Then he bent , pressed the key of the intercom . "
38826	38827	38823	38824	Miss French	203	" "
38833	38838	38823	38824	Miss French	203	" Miss French said , "
38853	38854	38849	38849	you	0	" "
38861	38888	38849	38849	you	0	" Garland settled back in his seat , grimly contemplating the far wall ; he said nothing to either Rick or Phil Resch . Resch said , "
38903	38904	38900	38901	Mr. Deckard	121	" "
38922	38923	38924	38924	Ours	1108	" "
38929	38942	38924	38924	Ours	1108	" Resch said . The reflex - arc response taking place in the upper
38963	38990	38991	38991	We	1108	" Reaching across Inspector Garland 's desk he plucked a pad of paper toward him ; with a ball - point pen he drew a sketch . "
39071	39082	39083	39083	You	0	" An interval of silence passed and then Rick said , "
39109	39110	39095	39095	I	0	" "
39113	39126	39127	39127	I	0	" Resch said . He was , however , studying Inspector Garland . "
39133	39167	39127	39127	I	0	" Resch murmured , that the Boneli Reflex - Arc Test should be applied routinely to police personnel the higher up the chain of command the better . Have n't I , Inspector ? "
39168	39175	39176	39176	Garland	200	" That 's right you have , "
39179	39197	39176	39176	Garland	200	" And I 've always opposed it . On the grounds that it would lower department morale . "
39198	39203	39204	39204	Rick	95	" I think now , "
39207	39229	39204	39204	Rick	95	" you 're going to have to sit still for it . In view of your lab 's report on Polokov . "
39234	39239	39240	39240	He	200	" I guess so . "
39251	39270	39240	39240	He	200	" But I 'm warning you : you 're not going to like the results of the tests . "
39271	39280	39281	39281	Resch	199	" Do you know what they 'll be ? "
39294	39302	39288	39288	he	199	" I know almost to a hair , "
39307	39310	39303	39304	Inspector Garland	200	" Okay . "
39314	39325	39326	39326	He	200	" I 'll go upstairs and get the Boneli gear . "
39345	39356	39357	39357	he	200	" I 'll be back in three or four minutes , "
39401	39411	39412	39412	Rick	95	" That 's not going to make any difference , "
39415	39421	39412	39412	Rick	95	" Resch will have a postmortem run
39459	39474	39457	39457	himself	199	" The laser tube remained in its position , and then Inspector Garland said , "
39502	39538	39499	39499	I	0	" By degrees he lowered the laser beam ; he sat gripping it and then he shrugged and returned it to the desk drawer , locking the drawer and restoring the key to his pocket . "
39549	39556	39557	39560	That damn fool Resch	199	" Rick asked . Garland said , "
39562	39563	39557	39560	That damn fool Resch	199	" "
39570	39571	39564	39564	He	199	" "
39612	39620	39577	39577	he	199	" Garland gestured toward Rick 's briefcase . "
39641	39648	39636	39636	I	0	" He paused , then said , "
39676	39692	39664	39664	he	199	" He was silent , then . Or rather it was silent . Rick said , "
39702	39703	39695	39695	he	199	" "
39712	39717	39704	39704	I	0	" Garland said remotely . "
39782	39783	39745	39745	He	199	" "
39796	39800	39790	39790	you	0	" Garland said , "
39840	39850	39851	39851	Your	95	" Irritably , Garland picked at his lower lip . "
39991	39992	39981	39981	Crams	196	" "
40001	40005	39996	39996	my	0	" Rick said . "
40059	40060	40062	40062	I	0	" "
40067	40071	40062	40062	I	0	" Rick said , "
40080	40081	40062	40062	I	0	" "
40165	40174	40193	40193	he	199	" He gestured convulsively toward the office door . "
40210	40211	40196	40196	He	199	" "
40215	40219	40196	40196	He	199	" Rick said , "
40232	40236	40196	40196	He	199	" Garland snapped , "
40262	40280	40255	40255	I	0	" The office door opened ; Phil Resch stood outlined , carrying a device which trailed wires . "
40285	40424	40425	40425	It	1141	" he said , closing the door after him ; he seated himself , plugging the device into the electrical outlet . Bringing out his right hand , Garland pointed at Resch . At once Resch - and also Rick Deckard - rolled from their chairs and onto the floor ; at the same time , Resch . aimed a laser tube and , as he fell , fired at Garland . The laser beam , aimed with skill , based on years of training , bifurcated Inspector Garland 's head . He slumped forward and , from his hand , his miniaturized laser beam rolled across the surface of his desk . The corpse teetered on its chair and then , like a sack of eggs , it slid to one side and crashed to the floor . "
40428	40437	40425	40425	It	1141	" Resch said , rising to his feet , "
40464	40487	40459	40459	you	1143	" He put his laser beam away , bent , and , with curiosity , examined the body of his quondam superior . "
40499	40499	40459	40459	you	1143	"
40500	40512	40529	40529	he	95	" That he - it - was an android . And you- "
40538	40543	40544	40544	he	95	" -would detect it , "
40547	40554	40529	40529	he	95	" In a few more minutes . "
40555	40559	40529	40529	he	95	" Anything else ? "
40560	40568	40569	40569	Resch	199	" This building is android - infested . "
40573	40614	40569	40569	Resch	199	" That 's going to make it hard for you and me to get out of here . Nominally I have the authority to leave any time I want , of course . And to take a prisoner with me . "
40626	40650	40653	40653	he	95	" I guess they did n't hear anything . There 's evidently no bug installed here , monitoring everything as there should be . "
40667	40713	40653	40653	he	95	" It certainly is remarkable , the psionic ability you develop in this business ; I knew before I opened the office door that he would take a shot at me . Frankly I 'm surprised he did n't kill you while I was upstairs , "
40714	40719	40720	40720	Rick	95	" He almost did , "
40723	40757	40720	40720	Rick	95	" He had a big utility - model laser beam on me part of the time . He was considering it . But it was you he was worried about , not me . "
40758	40763	40764	40764	Resch	199	" The android flees , "
40768	40832	40764	40764	Resch	199	" where the bounty bunter pursues . You realize , do n't you , that you 're going to have to double back to the opera house and get Luba Luft before anyone here has a chance to warn her as to how this came out . Warn it , I should say . Do you think of them as ' it ' ? "
40833	40840	40841	40841	Rick	95	" I did at one time , "
40844	40899	40841	40841	Rick	95	" When my conscience occasionally bothered me about the work I had to do ; I protected myself by thinking of them that way but now I no longer find it necessary . All right , I 'll head directly back to the opera house . Assuming you can get me out of here . "
40900	40910	40911	40911	Resch	199	" Suppose we sit Garland up at his desk , "
40966	40996	40962	40963	Phil Resch	199	" Inspector Garland has asked that no calls be put through to him for the next half hour . He 's involved in work that ca n't be interrupted . "
40997	41003	40962	40963	Phil Resch	199	" Yes , Mr. Resch . "
41015	41046	41047	41047	He	199	" I 'm going to handcuff you to me during the time we 're still here in the building . Once we 're airborne I 'll naturally let you go . "
41067	41078	41079	41079	He	199	" Come on ; let 's get it over with . "
41134	41141	41142	41142	Resch	199	" What I 'm afraid of , "
41151	41170	41171	41171	He	199	" is that the Garland one had a dead man 's throttle warning component built into it . But- "
41174	41193	41171	41171	He	199	" I would have expected it to go off by now ; otherwise it 's not much good . "
41228	41239	41240	41240	Resch	199	" Do you think your department will take me on ? "
41267	41286	41256	41256	he	199	" After all , as of now I 'm out of a job . To say the least . "
41292	41309	41289	41289	Rick	95	" I - don't see why not . Except that we already have two bounty hunters . "
41373	41381	41382	41383	Phil Resch	199	" I ca n't get over it , "
41386	41420	41382	41383	Phil Resch	199	" It does n't seem possible . For three years I 've been working under the direction of androids . Why did n't I suspect - I mean , enough to do something ? "
41421	41437	41382	41383	Phil Resch	199	" Maybe it is n't that long . Maybe they only recently infiltrated this building . "
41438	41461	41382	41383	Phil Resch	199	" They 've been here all the time . Garland has been my superior from the start , throughout my three years . "
41462	41467	41468	41468	Rick	95	" According to it , "
41471	41501	41468	41468	Rick	95	" the bunch of them came to Earth together . And that was n't as long ago as three years ; it 's only been a matter of months . "
41502	41512	41513	41514	Phil Resch	199	" Then at one time an authentic Garland existed , "
41517	41526	41513	41514	Phil Resch	199	" And somewhere along the way got replaced . "
41538	41561	41533	41533	he	199	" Or - I've been impregnated with a false memory system . Maybe I only remember Garland over the whole time . But- "
41578	41596	41562	41562	His	199	" Only androids show up with false memory systems ; it 's been found ineffective in humans . "
41631	41637	41638	41639	Phil Resch	199	" Here 's my car , "
41715	41720	41721	41721	he	199	" Listen , Deckard , "
41725	41736	41721	41721	he	199	" After we retire Luba Luft - I want you to- "
41747	41768	41737	41737	His	199	" You know . Give me the Boneli test or that empathy scale you have . To see about me . "
41769	41777	41778	41778	Rick	95	" We can worry about that later , "
41781	41794	41778	41778	Rick	95	" You do n't want me to take it , do you ? "
41804	41829	41830	41830	Rick	95	" I guess you know what the results will be ; Garland must have told you something . Facts which I do n't know . "
41833	41871	41830	41830	Rick	95	" It 's going to be hard even for the two of us to take out Luba Luft ; she 's more than I could handle , anyhow . Let 's keep our attention focused on that . "
41872	41881	41882	41883	Phil Resch	199	" It 's not just false memory structures , "
41886	41998	41882	41883	Phil Resch	199	" I own an animal ; not a false one but the real thing . A squirrel . I love the squirrel , Deckard ; every goddamn morning I feed it and change its papers - you know , clean up its cage - and then in the evening when I get off work I let it loose in my apt and it runs all over the place . It has a wheel in its cage ; ever seen a squirrel running inside a wheel ? It runs and runs , the wheel spins , but the squirrel stays in the same spot . Buffy seems to like it , though . "
41999	42008	42009	42009	Rick	95	" I guess squirrels are n't too bright , "
42045	42055	42056	42057	Phil Resch	199	" Did she say where she intended to go ? "
42067	42073	42074	42075	The stagehand	1173	" Over to the museum . "
42081	42087	42074	42075	The stagehand	1173	" She said she wanted to take
42104	42134	42059	42060	the stagehand	1173	" And Luba Luft , Rick thought to himself , ends today . As the two of them walked down the sidewalk to the museum , Phil Resch said , "
42154	42155	42145	42145	we	1178	" "
42158	42264	42145	42145	we	1178	" Rick said . They arrived at the museum building , noted on which floor the Munch exhibit could be found , and ascended . Shortly , they wandered amid paintings and woodcuts . Many people had turned out for the exhibit , including a grammar school class ; the shrill voice of the teacher penetrated all the rooms comprising the exhibit , and Rick thought , That 's what you 'd expect an andy to sound - and look - like . Instead of like Rachael Rosen and Luba Luft . And - the man beside him . Or rather the thing beside him . "
42279	42310	42266	42266	you	1180	" Phil Resch asked him . For sonic obscure reason he felt the need to be brutally honest ; perhaps he had already begun preparing himself for what lay ahead . "
42369	42370	42548	42548	I	0	" "
42403	42527	42528	42528	He	0	" At an oil painting Phil Resch halted , gazed intently . The painting showed a hairless , oppressed creature with a head like an inverted pear , its hands clapped in horror to its ears , its mouth open in a vast , soundless scream . Twisted ripples of the creature 's torment , echoes of its cry , flooded out into the air surrounding it ; the man or woman , whichever it was , had become contained by its own howl . It had covered its ears against its own sound . The creature stood on a bridge and no one else was present ; the creature screamed in isolation . Cut off by - or despite - its outcry . "
42535	42547	42528	42528	He	0	" Rick said , reading the card tacked below the painting . "
42551	42556	42548	42548	I	0	" Phil Resch said , "
42566	42586	42587	42587	I	0	" He traced in the air the convolutions , visible in the picture , of the creature 's cry . "
42600	42615	42596	42596	I	0	" He broke off , as several persons strolled up to inspect the picture . "
42621	42665	42618	42619	Luba Luft	169	" Rick pointed and Phil Resch halted his somber introspection and defense ; the two of them walked at a measured pace toward her , taking their time as if nothing confronted them ; as always it was vital to preserve the atmosphere of the
42758	42767	42768	42768	Rick	95	" Want me to buy it for you ? "
42856	42863	42853	42854	Inspector Garland	200	" It 's not for sale . "
42923	42938	42944	42944	he	95	" I thought they arrested you . Do you mean they let you go ? "
42939	42943	42944	42944	he	95	" Miss Luft , "
42947	42968	42944	42944	he	95	" this is Mr. Resch . Phil Resch , this is the quite well - known opera singer Luba Luft . "
42974	43017	42971	42971	he	95	" The harness bull that arrested me is an android . So was his superior . Do you know - did you know - an Inspector Garland ? He told me that you all came here in one ship as a group . "
43018	43026	42944	42944	he	95	" The police department which you called , "
43033	43070	43027	43028	Phil Resch	199	" operating out of a building on Mission , is the organizing agency by which it would appear your group keeps in touch . They even feel confident enough to hire a human bounty hunter ; evidently- "
43071	43074	43075	43076	Luba Luft	169	" You ? "
43079	43098	43075	43076	Luba Luft	169	" You 're not human . No more than I am : you 're an android , too . "
43116	43129	43106	43107	Phil Resch	199	" Well , we 'll deal with that at the proper time . "
43135	43144	43132	43132	he	199	" Let 's take her to my car . "
43368	43371	43372	43372	she	169	" Listen , "
43398	43425	43389	43389	she	169	" Buy me a reproduction of that picture I was looking at when you found me . The one of the girt sitting on the bed . "
43449	43460	43429	43429	Rick	95	" Do you have a print of Munch 's Puberty ? "

43574	43593	43566	43566	Luba	169	" There 's something very strange and touching about humans . An android would never have done that . "
43601	43620	43621	43621	She	875	" It would n't have occurred to him ; as he said , never in a million years . "
43635	43693	43621	43621	She	875	" I really do n't like androids . Ever since I got here from Mars my life has consisted of imitating the human , doing what she would do , acting as if I had the thoughts and impulses a human would have . Imitating , as far as I 'm concerned , a superior life form . "
43700	43716	43697	43697	she	875	" Is n't that how it 's been with you , Resch ? Trying to be- "
43717	43724	43725	43726	Phil Resch	199	" I ca n't take this . "
43734	43737	43738	43738	Rick	95	" No , "

44125	44131	44132	44133	Phil Resch	199	" You 're claiming Garland ? "
44136	44159	44132	44133	Phil Resch	199	" But I killed him , not you . You just lay there . And Luba , too . I got her . "

44170	44215	44167	44167	Rick	95	" Not from your own department and not from ours . When we get to your car I 'll administer the Boneli test or the Voigt - Kampff to you and then we 'll see . Even though you 're not on my list . "
44232	44261	44220	44220	he	95	" No , you 're not here . So legally I ca n't claim you ; to make anything I 'll have to claim Luba Luft and Garland . "
44262	44278	44220	44220	he	95	" You 're sure I 'm an android ? Is that really what Garland said ? "
44279	44286	44220	44220	he	95	" That 's what Garland said . "

That 's why you picked up on the possibility of Garland being an android ; it made him available for being killed . I wonder what you 're going to do when you fail to pass the Boneli test . Will you kill yourself ? Sometimes androids do that . "

52005	52013	51997	51997	she	215	" Think what he could call you . "
52023	52033	52034	52034	Roy	216	" I 'll go start rigging up the bug , "
52037	52055	52056	52056	He	151	" Irmgard and I 'll stay in this apartment ; Pris you go with - Mr. Isidore . "
52154	52158	52159	52159	Pris	152	" A man , "
52163	52181	52159	52159	Pris	152	" of action . Too bad he 's so poor with his hands , doing mechanical things . "
52182	52188	52189	52189	Irmgard	215	" If we get saved , "
52203	52211	52189	52189	Irmgard	215	" it 'll be because of Roy . "
52212	52219	52220	52220	Pris	152	" But is it worth it , "
52235	52252	52227	52227	She	152	" Okay , J .R. I 'll move in with you and you can protect me . "
52253	52262	52263	52263	Isidore	151	" A - a - all of you , "
52281	52326	52327	52327	She	215	" I want you to know we appreciate it very much , Mr. Isidore . You 're the first friend I think any of us have found here on Earth . It 's very nice of you and maybe sometime we can repay you . "
52337	52350	52351	52351	he	151	" Do you have any pre - colonial fiction I could read ? "
52355	52358	52353	52353	her	215	" Pardon ? "
52366	52371	52364	52364	Pris	152	" Those old magazines , "
52409	52427	52388	52388	Isidore	151	" No , J.R. We did n't bring any back with us , for reasons I explained . "
52428	52441	52442	52442	he	151	" I 'll g - g - go to a library tomorrow , "
52451	52475	52442	52442	he	151	" And g - get you and me too some to read , so you 'll have something to do besides just waiting . "
52521	52526	52527	52527	Pris	152	" I like this , "
52578	52584	52585	52585	he	151	" What 's the matter ? "
52597	52600	52601	52601	She	152	" Nothing . "
52618	52627	52628	52628	he	151	" If you think they 're looking for you- "
52631	52637	52638	52638	Pris	152	" It 's a dream , "
52641	52650	52638	52638	Pris	152	" Induced by drugs that Roy gave me . "
52651	52656	52638	52638	Pris	152	" P - pardon ? "
52657	52666	52638	52638	Pris	152	" You really think that bounty hunters exist ? "
52667	52676	52638	52638	Pris	152	" Mr. Baty said they killed your friends . "
52677	52687	52688	52688	Pris	152	" Roy Baty is as crazy as I am , "
52691	52730	52688	52688	Pris	152	" Our trip was between a mental hospital on the East Coast and here . We 're all schizophrenic , with defective emotional lives - flattening of affect , it 's called . And we have group hallucinations . "
52740	52753	52754	52754	She	152	" he said full of relief . ' Why did n't you ? "
52773	52800	52762	52762	her	152	" B - b - because things like that do n't happen . The g - government never kills anyone , for any crime . And Mercerism- "
52801	52806	52807	52807	Pris	152	" But you see , "
52810	52823	52807	52807	Pris	152	" if you 're not human , then it 's all different . "
52824	52845	52762	52762	her	152	" That 's not true . Even animals - even eels and gophers and snakes and spiders - are sacred . "
52855	52895	52846	52846	Pris	152	" So it ca n't be , can it ? As you say , even animals are protected by law . All life . Everything organic that wriggles or squirms or burrows or flies or swarms or lays eggs or- "
52925	52928	52929	52929	he	216	" Insects , "
52939	52944	52929	52929	he	216	" are especially sacrosanct . "
52976	52981	52982	52982	He	216	" Now the alarm . "
53011	53033	53034	53034	He	216	" The alarm . These wires go under the carpet ; they 're antennae . It picks up the presence of a- "
53037	53042	53043	53043	he	216	" A mentational entity , "
53047	53056	53043	53043	he	216	" which is n't one of us four . "
53057	53062	53063	53063	Pris	152	" So it rings , "
53066	53089	53063	53063	Pris	152	" and then what ? He 'll have a gun . We ca n't fall on him and bite him to death . "
53090	53094	53095	53095	Roy	216	" This assembly , "
53098	53186	53187	53187	He	216	" has a Penfield unit built into it . When the alarm has been triggered it radiates a mood of panic to the - intruder . Unless he acts very fast , which he may . Enormous panic ; I have the gain turned all the way up . No human being can remain in the vicinity more than a matter of seconds . That 's the nature of panic : it leads to random circus - motions , purposeless flight , and muscle and neural spasms . "
53190	53210	53187	53187	He	216	" Which will give us an opportunity to get him . Possibly . Depending on how good he is . "
53214	53222	53211	53211	Isidore	112	" Wo n't the alarm affect us ? "
53223	53228	53229	53229	Pris	152	" That 's right , "
53235	53241	53229	53229	Pris	152	" It 'll affect Isidore . "
53242	53248	53249	53249	Roy	216	" Well , so what , "
53259	53305	53306	53306	Pris	152	" So they both go racing out of here panic - stricken . It 'll still give us time to react . And they wo n't kill Isidore ; he 's not on their list . That 's why he 's usable as a cover . "
53310	53320	53306	53306	Pris	152	" You ca n't do any better , Roy ? "
53321	53324	53325	53325	he	216	" No , "
53328	53333	53325	53325	he	216	" I ca n't . "
53334	53349	53350	53350	Isidore	112	" I 'll be able to g - g - get a weapon tomorrow , "
53354	53369	53370	53370	Pris	152	" You 're sure Isidore 's presence here wo n't set off the alarm ? "
53373	53380	53370	53370	Pris	152	" After all , he'syou know . "
53381	53390	53391	53391	Roy	216	" I 've compensated for his cephalic emanations , "
53394	53399	53391	53391	Roy	216	" Their sum wo n't trip
53411	53426	53409	53409	Person	1380	" Scowling , he glanced at Isidore , aware of what he had said . "
53431	53448	53449	53449	I	0	" Isidore said . But he did n't care ; it made no difference to him . "
53458	53462	53452	53452	they	1383	" he said . "
53469	53497	53464	53464	you	1381	" Everything made sense to him , now . The bounty hunter , the killing of their friends , the trip to Earth , all these precautions . "
53506	53514	53515	53515	I	0	" ' Roy Baty said to Pris , "
53521	53522	53515	53515	I	0	" "
53530	53534	53527	53528	Mr. Baty	225	" Isidore said . "
53568	53578	53563	53563	I	0	" He found himself yabbering away like a folletto . "
53587	53600	53601	53601	You	0	" He calmed himself . After a pause Roy Baty said laconically , "
53612	53613	53607	53607	You	0	" "
53622	53628	53630	53630	you	0	" Pris said to Isidore , "
53641	53653	53654	53655	Roy Baty	216	" That 's what probably tripped up Garland and Max Polokov , "
53658	53672	53654	53655	Roy Baty	216	" They were so goddamn sure they could pass . Luba , too . "
53673	53678	53679	53679	Isidore	112	" You 're intellectual , "
53694	53702	53703	53703	He	112	" You think abstractly , and you don't- "
53717	53757	53703	53703	He	112	" I wish I had an IQ like you have ; then I could pass the test , I would n't be a chickenhead . I think you 're very superior ; I could learn a lot from you . "
53765	53774	53775	53775	He	216	" I 'll finish wiring up the alarm . "
53779	53786	53787	53787	Pris	152	" He does n't understand yet , "
53798	53810	53787	53787	Pris	152	" how we got off Mars . What we did there . "
53811	53819	53820	53821	Roy Baty	216	" What we could n't help doing , "
53845	53858	53859	53859	she	215	" I do n't think we have to worry about Mr. Isidore , "
53875	53935	53863	53863	she	215	" They do n't treat him very well either , as he said . And what we did on Mars he is n't interested in ; he knows us and he likes us and an emotional acceptance like that - it 's everything to him . It 's hard for us to grasp that , but it 's true . "
53954	53972	53938	53938	she	215	" You could get a lot of money by turning us in ; do you realize that ? "
53981	53995	53975	53975	she	215	" See , he realizes that but still he would n't say anything . "
53996	54005	54006	54006	Pris	152	" You 're a great man , Isidore , "
54009	54018	53975	53975	she	215	" You 're a credit to your race . "
54019	54026	54027	54027	Roy	216	" If he was an android , "
54031	54061	54027	54027	Roy	216	" he 'd turn us in about ten tomorrow morning . He 'd take off for his job and that would be it . I 'm overwhelmed with admiration . "
54077	54099	54100	54100	He	216	" And we imagined this would be a friendless world , a planet of hostile faces , all turned against us . "
54113	54130	54131	54131	Roy	216	" Irmgard said . ' You ought to be seared to the soles of your feet , "
54134	54139	54131	54131	Roy	216	" Let 's vote , "
54143	54157	54140	54140	Pris	152	" As we did on the ship , when we had a disagreement . "
54158	54161	54162	54162	Irmgard	215	" Well , "
54165	54202	54162	54162	Irmgard	215	" I wo n't say anything more . But if we turn this down I do n't think we 'll find any other human being who 'll take us in and help us . Mr. Isidore is- "
54209	54212	54213	54213	Pris	152	" Special , "
54228	54233	54234	54234	Irmgard	215	" We stay here , "
54240	54249	54234	54234	Irmgard	215	" In this apartment , in this building . "
54254	54266	54267	54267	He	216	" I vote we kill Mr. Isidore and hide somewhere else . "
54287	54296	54297	54297	She	152	" I vote we make our stand here . "
54303	54351	54297	54297	She	152	" I think J.R. 's value to us outweighs his danger , that of his knowing . Obviously we ca n't live among humans without being discovered ; that 's what killed Polokov and Garland and Luba and Anders . That 's what killed all of them . "
54352	54362	54363	54364	Roy Baty	216	" Maybe they did just what we 're doing , "
54367	54389	54363	54364	Roy Baty	216	" Confided in , trusted , one given human being who they believed was different . As you said , special . "
54390	54397	54398	54398	Irmgard	215	" We do n't know that , "
54401	54413	54414	54414	She	215	" That 's only a conjecture . I think they , they- "
54417	54451	54452	54452	She	215	" Walked around . Sang from a stage like Luba . We trust - I'll tell you what we trust that fouls us up , Roy ; it 's our goddamn superior intelligence ! "
54468	54491	54492	54492	Pris	152	" We 're so smart -Roy , you 're doing it right now ; goddamn you , you 're doing it now ! "
54495	54502	54492	54492	Pris	152	" I think Irm 's right . "
54503	54514	54515	54515	Roy	216	" So we hang our lives on a substandard , blighted- "
54522	54527	54528	54528	he	216	" I 'm tired , "
54532	54550	54528	54528	he	216	" It 's been a long trip , Isidore . But not very long here . Unfortunately . "
54551	54555	54556	54556	Isidore	151	" I hope , "
54560	54572	54576	54576	he	216	" I can help make your stay here on Earth pleasant . "
54735	54740	54741	54746	a nattily dressed new animal salesman	1396	" Yes , sit , "
54767	54773	54774	54774	Rick	95	" See anything you like ? "
54777	54793	54774	54774	Rick	95	" I see a lot I like . It 's the cost that bothers me . "
54794	54805	54806	54807	the salesman	590	" You tell us the deal you want to make , "
54810	54843	54806	54807	the salesman	590	" What you want to take home with you and how you want to pay for it . We 'll take the package to our sales manager and get his big okay . "
54844	54852	54774	54774	Rick	95	" I 've got three thou cash . "
54869	54873	54874	54874	he	95	" How much , "
54877	54886	54874	54874	he	95	" is that family of rabbits over there ? "
54887	54921	54806	54807	the salesman	590	" Sir , if you have a down payment of three thou , I can make you owner of something a lot better than a pair of rabbits . What about a goat ? "
54922	54931	54932	54932	Rick	95	" I have n't thought much about goats , "
54935	54949	54932	54932	Rick	95	" May I ask if this represents a new price bracket for you ? "
54950	54962	54963	54963	Rick	95	" Well , I do n't usually carry around three thou , "
54966	55022	54963	54963	Rick	95	" I thought as much , sit , when you mentioned rabbits . The thing about rabbits , sit , is that everybody has one . I 'd like to see you step up to the goat - class where I feel you belong . Frankly you look more like a goat man to me . "
55023	55031	55032	55034	The animal salesman	1859	" What are the advantages to goats ? "
55037	55059	55032	55034	The animal salesman	1859	" The distinct advantage of a goat is that it can be taught to butt anyone who tries to steal it . "
55060	55081	55082	55082	Rick	95	" Not if they shoot it with a hypno - dart and descend by rope ladder from a hovering hovercar , "
55092	55214	55085	55086	The salesman	590	" A goat is loyal . And it has a free , natural soul which no cage can chain up . And there is one exceptional additional feature about goats , one which you may not be aware of . Often times when you invest in an animal and take it home you find , some morning , that it 's eaten something radioactive and died . A goat is n't bothered by contaminated quasi - foodstuffs ; it can eat eclectically , even items that would fell a cow or a horse or most especially a cat . As a long term investment we feel that the goat - especially the female - offers unbeatable advantages to the serious animalowner . "
55215	55222	55223	55223	He	95	" Is this goat a female ? "
55260	55310	55313	55313	his	95	" Yes , this goat is a female . A black Nubian goat , very large , as you can see . This is a superb contender in this year 's market , sir . And we 're offering her at an attractive , unusually low , low price . "
55330	55338	55339	55340	the salesman	590	" Will this be a cash deal ? "
55343	55353	55339	55340	the salesman	590	" Or are you trading in a used animal ? "
55354	55358	55359	55359	Rick	95	" All cash , "
55384	55388	55389	55389	Rick	95	" -too much , "
55406	55417	55418	55419	the salesman	590	" We could n't let a goat go for that , "
55427	55445	55446	55446	He	590	" This goat is less than a year old ; she has a very long life expectancy . "
55453	55459	55460	55460	Rick	95	" It 's a deal , "
55793	55796	55797	55797	Iran	96	" Hi , "
55808	55814	55797	55797	Iran	96	" Why so late tonight ? "
55815	55822	55823	55823	he	95	" Come up to the roof , "
55826	55834	55823	55823	he	95	" I want to show you something . "
55835	55841	55842	55842	She	1409	" You bought an animal . "
55872	55882	55883	55883	Iran	96	" You should n't have gotten it without me , "
55886	55904	55883	55883	Iran	96	" I have a right to participate in the decision , the most important acquisition we 'll ever- "
55905	55914	55915	55915	he	95	" I wanted it to be a surprise , "
55918	55926	55927	55927	Iran	96	" You made some bounty money today , "
55935	55943	55944	55944	He	95	" Yes . I retired three andys . "
55956	55963	55964	55964	he	95	" I had to buy this , "
55967	55995	55964	55964	he	95	" Something went wrong , today ; something about retiring them . It would n't have been possible for me to go on without getting an animal . "
56044	56049	56050	56050	Iran	96	" Oh my god , "
56076	56082	56083	56083	she	280	" Is it really real ? "
56086	56092	56083	56083	she	280	" It 's not false ? "
56093	56097	56098	56098	he	95	" Absolutely real , "
56101	56107	56098	56098	he	95	" Unless they swindled me . "
56135	56144	56083	56083	she	280	" No , they did n't swindle me . "
56145	56151	56152	56152	Iran	96	" It 's a goat , "
56155	56161	56152	56152	Iran	96	" A black Nubian goat . "
56162	56165	56083	56083	she	280	" Female , "
56169	56192	56166	56166	Rick	95	" So maybe later on we can mate her . And we 'll get milk out of which we can make cheese . "
56193	56207	56083	56083	she	280	" Can we let her out ? Put her where the sheep is ? "
56208	56215	56216	56216	he	95	" She ought to be tethered , "
56219	56227	56216	56216	he	95	" For a few days at least . "

56447	56467	56444	56444	Iran	96	" It certainly does cure my depression . Now we can admit to everybody that the sheep 's false . "

They gave me a bag of oats to start us out . And we can read the manual on goat maintenance ; they included that , too , at no extra charge . We can call her Euphemia . "

56729	56780	56781	56781	She	1431	" And I remember thinking how much better we are , how much better off , when we 're with Mercer . Despite the pain . Physical pain but spiritually together ; I felt everyone else , all over the world , all who had fused at the same time . "
56790	56841	56842	56842	She	1431	" Get in , Rick . This 'll be just for a moment . You hardly ever undergo fusion ; I want you to transmit the mood you 're in now to everyone else ; you owe it to them . It would be immoral to keep it for ourselves . "
56896	56903	56904	56904	she	1431	" I want everyone to know , "
56908	56932	56904	56904	she	1431	" Once that happened to me ; I fused and picked up someone who had just acquired an animal . And then one day- "

But others of us shared our different joys with them - I did n't have any , as you might know - and that cheered the person up . We might even reach a potential suicide ; what we have , what we 're feeling , might- "

57226	57276	57223	57223	he	95	" One I never saw before . A predatory one who seemed to like to destroy them . For the first time , after being with him , I looked at them differently . I mean , in my own way I had been viewing them as he did . "

57290	57442	57287	57287	Rick	95	" I took a test , one question , and verified it ; I 've begun to empathize with androids , and look what that means . You said it this morning yourself . ' Those poor andys . ' So you know what I 'm talking about . That 's why I bought the goat . I never felt like that before . Maybe it could be a depression , like you get . I can understand now how you suffer when you 're depressed ; I always thought you liked it and I thought you could have snapped yourself out any time , if not alone then by means of the mood organ . But when you get that depressed you do n't care . Apathy , because you 've lost a sense of worth . It does n't matter whether you feet better because if you have no worth- "
57443	57449	57450	57450	Her	1438	" What about your job ? "

57512	57544	57505	57505	she	1438	" The interest ; good god - the interest alone . And you did this because you were depressed . Not as a surprise for me , as you originally said . "
57553	57583	57545	57545	She	1438	" Well , it does n't matter . I 'm still glad you got the goat ; I love the goat . But it 's such an economic burden . "
57591	57619	57588	57588	Rick	95	" I can get switched to some other desk . The department does ten or eleven separate jobs . Animal theft ; I could transfer to that . "
57620	57636	57734	57734	Iran	96	" But the bounty money . We need it or they 'll repossess the goat ! "
57637	57654	57655	57655	He	1439	" I 'll get the contract extended from thirty - six months to forty - eight . "
57673	57687	57655	57655	He	1439	" That way it 'll be fifty - two fifty less a month . "

58438	58667	58430	58430	you	119	" Rick said . He hung up . A real sheep this time , he said to himself . I have to get one . In compensation . At the black empathy box his wife crouched , her face rapt . He stood beside her for a time , his hand resting on her breast ; he felt it rise and fall , the life in her , the activity . Iran did not notice him ; the experience with Mercer had , as always , become complete . On the screen the faint , old , robed figure of Mercer toiled upward , and all at once a rock sailed past him . Watching , Rick thought , My god ; there 's something worse about my situation than his . Mercer does n't have to do anything alien to him . He suffers but at least he is n't required to violate his own identity . Bending , he gently removed his wife 's fingers from the twin handles . He then himself took her place . For the first time in weeks . An impulse : he had n't planned it ; all at once it had happened . A landscape of weeds confronted him , a desolation . The air smelled of harsh blossoms ; this was the desert , and there was no rain .

58873	58947	58868	58870	The old man	1449	" You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go . It is the basic condition of life , to be required to violate your own identity . At some time , every creature which lives must do so . It is the ultimate shadow , the defeat of creation ; this is the curse at work , the curse that feeds on all life . Everywhere in the universe .

And she can go back to Seattle and live my life . I never felt this way before . We are machines , stamped out like bottle caps . It 's an illusion that I - I - personary - really exist ; I 'm just representative of a type . "

62526	62588	62468	62468	she	1507	" On the test or otherwise . Everything that gives it a different quality . And then I report back and the association makes modifications of its zygote - bath DNS factors . And we then have the Nexus-7 . And when that gets caught we modify it again and eventually the association has a type that ca n't be distinguished . "

I 'm just an observer and I wo n't intervene to save you ; I do n't care if Roy Baty nails you or not . I care whether I get nailed . "
62875	62899	62900	62900	She	1507	" Christ , I 'm empathic about myself . And , see , if I go to that suburban broken - down conapt building- "
62922	62959	62917	62917	she	1507	" I do n't dare go because androids have no loyalty to one another and I know that that goddamn Pris Stratton will destroy me and occupy my place . See ? Take off your coat . "
62960	62963	62917	62917	she	1507	" Why ? "
62964	62972	62973	62973	Rachael	137	" So we can go to bed , "

We 're not born ; we do n't grow up ; instead of dying from illness or old age we wear out like ants . Ants again ; that 's what we are . Not you ; I mean me . Chitinous reflex - machines who are n't really alive . "

65730	65772	65727	65727	she	137	" There 's a fine ; I 'm the property , the legal property , of the association . I 'm not an escaped android who fled here from Mars ; I 'm not in the same class as the others . "

65826	65875	65876	65876	Rick	95	" I never can lay my hands on anything in it . Will you kill me in a way that wo n't hurt ? I mean , do it carefully . If I do n't fight ; okay ? I promise not to fight . Do you agree ? "
65879	65918	65876	65876	Rick	95	" I understand now why Phil Resch said what he said . He was n't being cynical ; he had just learned too much . Going through this - I ca n't blame him . It warped him . "
65919	65925	65926	65926	She	137	" But the wrong way . "

66945	66986	66938	66939	Roy Baty	216	" It 's Buster Friendly and his Friendly Friends that we want to watch , Iz . Or do you want me to call you J.R. ? Anyhow , do you understand ? So will you go get the set ? "
67357	67367	67368	67368	he	113	" We get a good signal in this building , "

67404	67419	67400	67401	Roy Baty	216	" And stop talking . He did so , then hurried to the door . "
67424	67428	67368	67368	he	113	" he said , "
67433	67446	67368	67368	he	113	" He lingered , warming himself at the hearth of their presence . "
67449	67507	67368	67368	he	113	" Pris said remotely . Isidore started off once more . I think , he thought , they 're exploiting me sort of . But he did not care . They 're still good friends to have , he said to himself . Downstairs again , he gathered the girl 's clothing together , stuffed every piece into the

This is Buster Friendly , who hopes and trusts you 're as eager as I am to share the discovery which I 've made and by the way had verified by top trained research workers working extra hours over the past weeks . Ho ho , folks ; this is it ! "
67675	67681	67671	67672	John Isidore	112	" I found a spider . "

67729	67737	67738	67738	Pris	152	" I 've never seen a spider , "
67755	67770	67741	67741	She	152	" All those legs . Why 's it need so many legs , J.R. ? "
67771	67779	67780	67780	Isidore	112	" That 's the way spiders are , "
67792	67796	67780	67780	Isidore	112	" Eight legs . "
67805	67824	67802	67802	Pris	152	" You know what I think , J.R. ? I think it does n't need all those legs . "
67825	67828	67829	67830	Irmgard Baty	215	" Eight ? "
67833	67850	67829	67830	Irmgard Baty	215	" Why could n't it get by on four ! ' Cut four off and see . "

67977	68009	67960	67960	Pris	152	" he said wheezingly . Imploringly . With the scissors Pris snipped off one of the spider 's legs . In the living room Buster Friendly on the TV screen said , "
68054	68075	68035	68036	Earl Parameter	253	" Pris clipped off another leg , restraining the spider with the edge of her hand . She was smiling . "
68082	68091	68035	68036	Earl Parameter	253	" a new voice from the TV said , "
68123	68124	68125	68125	You	152	" "
68130	68151	68125	68125	You	152	" Irmgard called anxiously to Pris ; she rushed to the kitchen door , saw what Pris had begun doing . "
68158	68179	68125	68125	You	152	" she said coaxingly . This is so important , what they 're saying ; it proves that everything we believed- "
68180	68184	68185	68186	Roy Baty	216	" Be quiet , "
68189	68193	68194	68194	Irmgard	215	" -is true , "
68202	68281	68125	68125	You	152	" The ' moon ' is painted ; in the enlargements , one of which you see now on your screen , brushstrokes show . And there is even some evidence that the scraggly weeds and dismal , sterile soil - perhaps even the stones hurled at Mercer by unseen alleged parties - are equally faked . It is quite possible in fact that the ' stones ' are made of soft plastic , causing no authentic wounds . "
68282	68287	68288	68289	Buster Friendly	97	" In other words , "
68293	68302	68303	68305	The research chief	1571	" Wilbur Mercer is not suffering at all . "
68308	68402	68303	68305	The research chief	1571	" We 've at last managed , Mr. Friendly , to track down a former Hollywood special - effects man , a Mr. Wade Cortot , who flatly states , from his years of ex - perience , that the figure of ' Mercer ' could well be merely some bit player marching across a sound stage . Cortot has gone so far as to declare that he recognizes the stage as one used by a now out - of - business minor moviemaker with whom Cortot had various dealings several decades ago . "
68403	68409	68410	68411	Buster Friendly	97	" So according to Cortot , "
68414	68422	68410	68411	Buster Friendly	97	" there can be virtually no doubt . "
68456	68463	68469	68469	his	1571	" Quite frankly we believed Cortot , "
68475	68500	68469	68469	his	1571	" and we spent a good deal of time examining publicity pictures of bit players once employed by the now defunct Hollywood movie industry . "
68501	68505	68469	68469	his	1571	" And you found- "
68506	68511	68512	68513	Roy Baty	216	" Listen to this , "
68533	68601	68527	68527	her	152	" We located , by means of thousands upon thousands of photographs , a very old man now , named Al Jarry , who played a number of bit parts in pre - war films . From our lab we sent a team to Jarry 's home in East Harmony , Indiana . I 'll let one of the members of that team describe what he found . "
68612	68684	68711	68712	the technician	1574	" The house on Lark Avenue in East Harmony is tottering and shabby and at the edge of town , where no one , except Al Jarry , still lives . Invited amiably in , and seated in the stalesmelling , moldering , kipple - filled living room , I scanned by telepathic means the blurred , debris - cluttered , and hazy mind of Al Jarry seated across from me .

68685	68688	68689	68690	Roy Baty	216	" Listen , "
68706	68710	68711	68712	the technician	1574	" I found , "
68715	68769	68711	68712	the technician	1574	" that the old man did in actuality make a series of short fifteen minute video films , for an employer whom he never met . And , as we had theorized , the ' rocks ' did consist of rubber - like plastic . The ' blood ' shed was catsup , and "

68798	68810	68795	68796	Al Jarry	256	" Buster Friendly said , his face returning to the screen . "

68974	68977	68965	68965	folks	1795	" Irmgard murmured .
68982	69010	68978	68979	Buster Friendly	97	" We may never know . Nor can we fathom the peculiar purpose behind this swindle . Yes , folks , swindle . Mercerism is a swindle ! "
69011	69017	69018	69019	Roy Baty	216	" I think we know , "
69022	69031	69018	69019	Roy Baty	216	" It 's obvious . Mercerism came into existence- "
69032	69037	69038	69039	Buster Friendly	97	" But ponder this , "
69042	69066	69038	69039	Buster Friendly	97	" Ask yourselves what is it that Mercerism does . Well , if we 're to be1ieve its many practitioners , the experience fuses- "

69129	69147	69105	69105	Mercer	103	" Irmgard said vigorously . Fists clenched , she roved into the kitchen , up to Isidore . "
69193	69214	69105	69105	Mercer	103	" She bent over Pris 's shoulder . With the scissors Pris snipped off another of the spider 's legs . "
69218	69227	69105	69105	Mercer	103	" she said . She nudged the spider . "
69237	69255	69234	69234	he	1588	" Roy Baty appeared at the doorway , inhaling deeply an expression of accomplishment on his face . "
69294	69305	69274	69274	him	97	" He came over to look curiously at the spider . "
69313	69317	69318	69318	I	0	" Irmgard said . "
69324	69357	69358	69358	I	0	" Roy Baty got out a book of matches , lit a match ; he held it near the spider , closer and closer , until at last it crept feebly away . "
69362	69366	69358	69358	I	0	" Irmgard said . "
69379	69387	69369	69369	I	0	" She peered up expectantly at Isidore . "
69393	69400	69369	69369	I	0	" Touching his arm she said , "
69448	69454	69455	69455	He	1590	" She prodded him anxiously . "
69459	69463	69455	69455	He	1590	" Pris said . "
69483	69492	69477	69477	you	1590	" she asked Isidore . Roy Baty said , "

69546	69552	69542	69544	unhappy human beings	1593	" To Isidore she said , "
69572	69579	69569	69569	Buster	97	" She hesitated and then said , "
69591	69592	69593	69594	An android	563	" "
69596	69600	69593	69594	An android	563	" Irmgard explained . "
69611	69671	69672	69672	He	1598	" Pris , with the scissors , cut yet another leg from the spider . All at once John Isidore pushed her away and lifted up the mutilated creature . He carried it to the sink and there he drowned it . In him his mind , his hopes , drowned , too . As swiftly as the spider . "
69677	69682	69672	69672	He	1598	" Irmgard said nervously . "
69698	69708	69694	69694	you	1599	" To Pris and to her husband she said , "

69746	69750	69726	69726	he	1598	" Pris said . "
69771	69800	69765	69765	He	1598	" she said to Irmgard , who had gone into the other room to shut off the TV . Regarding Isidore with easy amusement , Roy Baty said , "
69815	69832	69812	69812	I	0	" With his nails he managed to lift the corpse of the spider from the sink . "
69840	69844	69760	69762	John R. Isidore	112	" he said . "
69852	69856	69760	69762	John R. Isidore	112	" He reflected . "

69877	69914	69871	69871	I	0	" Isidore said . From the kitchen cupboard he got a cup ; he stood holding it for an interval - he did not know exactly how long . And then he said to Roy Baty , "
69927	69928	69929	69929	You	0	" "
69938	69943	69929	69929	You	0	" Roy Baty said . "

69954	70191	69929	69929	You	0	" Isidore said . Something ailed the three androids , something terrible . The spider , he thought . Maybe it had been the last spider on Earth , as Roy Baty said . And the spider is gone ; Mercer is gone ; he saw the dust and the ruin of the apartment as it lay spreading out everywhere - he heard the kipple coming , the final disorder of all forms , the absence which would win out . It grew around him as he stood holding the empty ceramic cup ; the cupboards of the kitchen creaked and split and he felt the floor beneath his feet give . Reaching out , he touched the wall . His hand broke the surface ; gray particles trickled and hurried down , fragments of plaster resembling the radioactive dust outside . He seated himself at the table and , like rotten , hollow tubes the legs of the chair bent ; standing quickly , he set down the cup and tried to reform the chair , tried to press it back into its right shape . The chair came apart in his hands , the screws which had previously connected its several sections ripping out and hanging loose . He saw , on the table , the ceramic cup crack ; webs of fine lines grew like the shadows of a vine , and then a chip

70905	70963	70902	70902	Mercer	103	" They 're sincere ; their research is sincere . From their standpoint I am an elderly retired bit player named Al Jarry . All of it , their disclosure , is true . They interviewed me at my home , as they claim ; I told them whatever they wanted to know , which was everything . "
70964	70970	70971	70971	Mercer	103	" Including about the whisky ? "

72906	72916	72919	72920	Mr. Deckard	121	" The rustling , ancient voice gained abrupt fervor . "
72926	72969	72919	72920	Mr. Deckard	121	" His laser tube thrust out , Rick spun and sank onto his haunches facing the flight of stairs . Up it glided a woman , toward him , and he knew her ; he recognized her and lowered his laser tube . "
72971	72993	72919	72920	Mr. Deckard	121	" he said , perplexed . Had she followed him in her own hovercar , tracked him here ? And why ? "

73018	73030	73008	73008	Mercer	103	" And then he saw that it was not quite Rachael . "
73040	73520	73008	73008	Mercer	103	" the android said as it approached him , its arms reaching as if to clutch at him . The clothes , he thought , are wrong . But the eyes , the same eyes . And there are more like this ; there can be a legion of her , each with its own name , but all Rachael Rosen - Rachael , the prototype , used by the manufacturer to protect the others . He fired at her as , imploringly , she dashed toward him . The android burst and parts of it flew ; he covered his face and then looked again , looked and saw the laser tube which it had carried roll away , back onto the stairs ; the metal tube bounced downward , step by step , the sound echoing and diminishing and slowing . The hard one of the three , Mercer had said . He peered about , searching for Mercer . The old man had gone . They can follow me with Rachael Rosens until I die , he thought , or until the type becomes obsolete , whichever comes first . And now the other two , he thought . One of them is not in the apartment , Mercer had said . Mercer protected me , he realized . Manifested himself and offered aid . She - it - would have gotten me , he said to himself , except for the fact that Mercer warned me . I can do the rest , now , he realized . This was the impossible one ; she knew I could n't do this . But it 's over . In an instant . I did what I could n't do . The Batys I can track by standard procedure ; they will be hard but they wo n't be like this . He stood alone in the empty hall ; Mercer had left him because he had done what he came for , Rachael - or rather Pris Stratton - had been dismembered and that left nothing now , only himself . But elsewhere in the building ; the Batys waited and knew . Perceived what he had done , here . Probably , at this point , they were afraid . This had been their response to his presence in the building . Their attempt . Without Mercer it would have worked . For them , winter had come . This has to be done quickly , what I 'm after now , he realized ; he hurried down the hall and all at once his detection gear registered the presence of cephalic activity . He had found their apartment . No more need of the gear ; he discarded it and rapped on the apartment door . From within , a man 's voice sounded . "

He closed the car door , flicked a signal with his hand to Iran , and then swept up into the night sky . Once , he thought , I would have seen the stars . Years ago . But now it 's only the dust ; no one has seen a star in years , at least not from Earth . Maybe I 'll go where I can see stars , he said to himself as the car gained velocity and altitude ; it headed away from San Francisco , toward the uninhabited desolation to the north . To the place where no living thing would go . Not unless it felt that the end had come .

I wonder why they did n't get me . Because I moved too fast , he decided . All in one day ; they could n't have expected it . Harry Bryant was right . The car had become too cold , now , so he opened the door and stepped out . A noxious , unexpected wind filtered through his clothes and he began to walk , rubbing his hands together . It would have been rewarding to talk to Dave , he decided . Dave would have approved what I did . But also he would have understood the other part , which I do n't think even Mercer comprehends . For Mercer everything is easy , he thought , because Mercer accepts everything . Nothing is alien to him . But what I 've done , he thought ; that 's become alien to me . In fact everything about me has become unnatural ; I 've become an unnatural self . He walked on , up the hillside , and with each step the weight on him grew . Too tired , he thought , to climb . Stopping , he wiped stinging sweat from his eyes , salt tears produced by his skin , his whole aching body . Then , angry at himself , he spat - spat with wrath and contempt , for himself , with utter hate , onto the barren ground . Thereupon he resumed his trudge up the slope , the lonely and unfamiliar terrain , remote from everything ; nothing lived here except himself .

77110	77113	77114	77114	he	1704	" No , "
77117	77126	77114	77114	he	1704	" I 'm no longer with the department . "
77127	77138	77139	77139	she	1724	" Obviously you did too much yesterday , Mr. Deckard , "
77143	77216	77139	77139	she	1724	" What you need now is bed rest . Mr. Deckard , you 're our best bounty hunter , the best we 've ever had . I 'll tell Inspector Bryant when he comes in ; you go on home and go to bed . Call your wife right away , Mr. Deckard , because she 's terribly , terribly worried . I could tell . You 're both in dreadful shape . "
77217	77225	77226	77226	he	1725	" It 's because of my goat , "
77229	77275	77226	77226	he	1725	" Not the androids ; Rachael was wrong - I did n't have any trouble retiring them . And the special was wrong , too , about my not being able to fuse with Mercer again . The only one who was right is Mercer . "
77276	77315	77139	77139	she	1724	" You better get back here to the Bay Area , Mr. Deckard . Where there 're people . There is n't anything living up there near Oregon ; is n't that right ? Are n't you alone ? "
77316	77321	77322	77322	Rick	95	" It 's strange , "
77325	77392	77322	77322	Rick	95	" I had the absolute , utter , completely real illusion that I had become Mercer and people were lobbing rocks at me . But not the way you experience it when you hold the handles of an empathy box . When you use an empathy box you feel you 're with Mercer . The difference is I was n't with anyone ; I was alone . "
77393	77404	77139	77139	she	1724	" They 're saying now that Mercer is a fake . "
77405	77412	77413	77413	he	95	" Mercer is n't a fake , "
77416	77423	77413	77413	he	95	" Unless reality is a fake . "
77445	77450	77451	77451	he	95	" I 'm afraid , "
77454	77474	77451	77451	he	95	" that I ca n't stop being Mercer . Once you start it 's too late to back off . "
77497	77500	77501	77501	he	95	" Goodby , "
77510	77520	77501	77501	he	95	" You 'll call your wife ? You promise ? "
77521	77524	77525	77525	He	95	" Yes . "
77528	77533	77525	77525	He	95	" Thanks , Ann . "
78921	78924	78925	78925	he	95	" Hi , "
79020	79028	79029	79029	she	1757	" It 's nice to see you , "
79032	79037	79029	79029	she	1757	" I have something . "
79091	79101	79088	79088	She	1757	" I 'll fix you a cup of coffee . "
79212	79219	79220	79220	he	95	" I 'm going to sleep , "
79223	79236	79220	79220	he	95	" All day . I phoned in and got Harry Bryant ; he said
79254	79292	79318	79318	he	95	" Carefully he set the box down on the table and picked up his coffee mug ; dutifully , because she wanted him to , he drank his coffee . Seating herself across from him she said , "
79303	79307	79295	79295	you	95	" A toad . "
79308	79314	79318	79318	he	95	" Can I see it ? "
79327	79330	79331	79331	she	1763	" Oh , "
79345	79350	79351	79351	she	1763	" Will it bite ? "
79354	79370	79371	79371	Rick	95	" Pick it up . It wo n't bite ; toads do n't have teeth . "
79389	79396	79397	79397	she	1763	" I thought toads were extinct , "
79415	79434	79397	79397	she	1763	" Can toads jump like frogs ? I mean , will it jump out of my hands suddenly ? "
79435	79443	79444	79444	Rick	95	" The legs of toads are weak , "
79447	79496	79497	79497	He	95	" That 's the main difference between a toad and a frog , that and water . A frog remains near water but a toad can live in the desert . I found this in the desert , up near the Oregon border . Where everything had died . "
79541	79544	79545	79545	His	95	" Oh . "
79551	79562	79565	79565	he	95	" Yeah , so I see ; you 're right . "
79605	79636	79596	79596	He	95	" I wonder how it got out there in the desolate part of California like that . Somebody must have put it there . No way to tell what for . "
79637	79651	79652	79652	She	1763	" Maybe I should n't have told you - about it being electrical . "
79677	79680	79681	79681	Rick	95	" No , "
79684	79693	79694	79694	He	95	" I 'm glad to know . Or rather- "
79698	79705	79694	79694	He	95	" I 'd prefer to know . "
79706	79736	79694	79694	He	95	" Do you want to use the mood organ ? To feel better ? You always have gotten a lot out of it , more than I ever have . "
79737	79743	79744	79744	He	95	" I 'll be okay . "
79759	79797	79744	79744	He	95	" The spider Mercer gave the chickenhead , Isidore ; it probably was artificial , too . But it does n't matter . The electric things have their lives , too . Paltry as those lives are . "
79801	79813	79798	79798	Iran	96	" You look as if you 've walked a hundred miles . "
79814	79822	79823	79823	He	95	" It 's been a long day . "
79826	79834	79823	79823	He	95	" Go get into bed and sleep . "
79846	79855	79835	79835	He	95	" It is over , is n't it ? "
79904	79909	79910	79910	she	1763	" It 's over , "
79913	79921	79922	79922	Rick	95	" God , what a marathon assignment , "
79925	79968	79922	79922	Rick	95	" Once I began on it there was n't any way for me to stop ; it kept carrying me along , until finally I got to the Batys , and then suddenly I did n't have anything to do . And that- "
79982	79988	79989	79989	he	95	" That part was worse , "
79992	80031	79989	79989	he	95	" After I finished . I could n't stop because there would be nothing left after I stopped . You were right this morning when you said I 'm nothing but a crude cop with crude cop hands . "
80032	80041	80042	80042	she	1763	" I do n't feel that any more , "
80045	80063	80042	80042	she	1763	" I 'm just damn glad to have you come back home where you ought to be . "
80096	80104	80105	80105	he	95	" Do you think I did wrong ? "
80108	80114	80105	80105	he	95	" What I did today ? "
80117	80118	80119	80119	Mercer	103	" "
80145	80146	80119	80119	Mercer	103	" "
80154	80158	80119	80119	Mercer	103	" Iran said . "
80164	80165	80160	80160	Mercer	103	" "
80169	80173	80160	80160	Mercer	103	" he asked . "
80261	80262	80250	80250	them	489	" "
80265	80269	80250	80250	them	489	" he said wanly .
80270	80289	80250	80250	them	489	" Will you go to bed now ? If I set the mood organ to a 670 setting ? "
80290	80297	80298	80298	he	0	" What does that bring about ? "
80301	80306	80307	80307	Iran	96	" Long deserved peace , "
80355	80358	80359	80359	he	0	" Okay , "
80362	80367	80368	80368	he	0	" Long deserved peace . "
80501	80504	80535	80535	she	1769	" ate , "
80545	80565	80539	80540	the saleswoman	1773	" I 'd like to order one pound of artificial flies that really fly around and buzz , please . "
80566	80576	80539	80540	the saleswoman	1773	" Is it for an electric turtle , ma'am ? "
80577	80581	80582	80582	she	1769	" A toad , "
80585	80602	80582	80582	she	1769	" Then I suggest our mixed assortment of artificial crawling and flying bugs of all types including- "
80603	80609	80610	80610	Iran	96	" The flies will do , "
80613	80642	80610	80610	Iran	96	" Will you deliver ? I do n't want to leave my apartment ; my husband 's asleep and I want to be sure he 's all right . "
80647	80720	80643	80644	The clerk	1196	" For a toad I 'd suggest also a perpetually renewing puddle , unless it 's a horned toad , in which case there 's a kit containing sand , multicolored pebbles , and bits of organic debris . And if you 're going to be putting it through its feed cycle regularly I suggest you let our service department make a periodic tongue adjustment . In a toad that 's vital . "
80721	80724	80725	80725	Iran	96	" Fine , "
80728	80743	80725	80725	Iran	96	" I want it to work perfectly . My husband is devoted to it . "
