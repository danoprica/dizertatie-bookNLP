10827	10886	10784	10784	He	829	" We 've built up a detailed model . Bought a go - to for each of your aliases and ran the skim through some military software . You 're suicidal , Casc . The model gives you a month on the outside . And our medical projection says you 'll need a new pancreas inside a year . "
10887	10892	10893	10893	He	829	" ' We . ' "
10900	10906	10893	10893	He	829	" ' We ' who ? "
10907	10926	10927	10927	Armitage	312	" What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage , Case ' ? "
10990	10998	10999	10999	Case	274	" What would you say , Case ? "
11008	11018	10999	10999	Case	274	" I 'd say you were full of shit . "
11022	11032	10999	10999	Case	274	" Then I 'd ask what your terms were . "
11033	11046	10999	10999	Case	274	" Not very different than what you 're used to , Case . "
11047	11057	11058	11058	Molly	437	" Let the man get some sleep , Armitage , "
11078	11087	11058	11058	Molly	437	" He 's coming apart at the seams . "
11088	11091	11092	11092	Case	274	" Terms , "
11095	11102	11092	11092	Case	274	" and now . Right now . "
11150	11160	11141	11141	he	274	" Scared , Case . You 're real scared . "
11208	11275	11276	11276	She	437	" It 'll work , Case . You got no idea , the kind of stuff Ar- mitage has . Like he 's gon na pay these nerve boys for fixing you with the program he 's giving them to tell them how to do it . He 'll put them three years ahead of the competition . You got any idea what that 's worth ? "
11323	11329	11330	11330	he	274	" You 're street samurai , "
11333	11341	11330	11330	he	274	" How long you work for him ? "
11342	11347	11367	11367	He	274	" Couple of months . "
11348	11354	11330	11330	he	274	" What about before that ? "
11355	11366	11367	11367	He	274	" For somebody else . Working girl , you know ? "
11370	11375	11367	11367	He	274	" Funny , Case . "
11376	11381	11330	11330	he	274	" What 's funny ? "
11382	11403	11330	11330	he	274	" It 's like I know you . That profile he 's got . I know how you 're wired . "
11404	11413	11367	11367	He	274	" You do n't know me , sister . "
11414	11432	11330	11330	he	274	" You 're okay , Case . What got you , it 's just called bad luck . "
11433	11443	11330	11330	he	274	" How about him ? He okay , Molly ? "
11498	11514	11525	11525	she	838	" What I always think about first , Case , is my own sweet ass . "
11590	11595	11596	11596	she	838	" In your shirt , "
11599	11607	11608	11608	He	274	" You want to answer my question ? "
11641	11680	11617	11617	she	838	" Well , I 'll tell you , the man 's definitely on to something . He 's got big money now , and he 's never had it before , and he gets more all the time . "
11690	11701	11702	11702	She	838	" Or maybe , maybe something 's on to him .... "
11705	11711	11702	11702	She	838	" What 's that mean ? "
11712	11735	11736	11736	He	274	" I do n't know , exactly . I know I do n't know who or what we 're really working for . "
11842	11860	11861	11862	The technician	844	" If you 'll come in now , sir , the anesthetist is waiting to meet you . "
12017	12030	12031	12031	She	851	" Stop it , Case , I got ta find your vein ! "
12045	12067	12031	12031	She	851	" You do n't lie still , I 'll slit your fucking throat . You 're still full of endorphin inhibitors . "
12133	12142	12143	12143	She	851	" Case ? It 's Wednesday , Case . "
12175	12178	12179	12179	She	851	" Here . "
12187	12206	12179	12179	She	851	" I can see in the dark , Case . Micro channel image - amps in my glasses . "
12207	12212	12162	12162	her	851	" My back hurts . "
12213	12272	12273	12273	She	851	" That 's where they replaced your fluid . Changed your blood too . Blood 'cause you got a new pancreas thrown into the deal . And some new tissue patched into your liver . The nerve stuff I dun no . Lot of injections . They did n't have to open anything up for the main show . "
12279	12296	12273	12273	She	851	" It 's 2:43:12 AM , Case . Got a readout chipped into my optic nerve . "
12320	12340	12341	12341	I	0	" I got ta punch deck , ' he heard himself say . He was groping for his clothes . "
12346	12358	12361	12361	hotshot	855	" She laughed . Small strong hands gripped his upper arms . "
12401	12407	12388	12388	they	856	" He lay down again . "
12412	12413	12388	12388	they	856	" "
12419	12420	12388	12388	they	856	" "
12425	12426	12388	12388	they	856	" "
12456	12462	12388	12388	they	856	" She touched his shoulder . "
12472	12523	12466	12466	I	0	" He lay on his stomach , arms stretched forward , tips of his fingers against the walls of the coffin . She settled over the small of his back , kneeling on the temper foam , the leather jeans cool against his skin . Her fingers brushed his neck . "
12533	12656	12466	12466	I	0	" She answered him by reaching back , between his thighs and gently encircling his scrotum with thumb and forefinger . She rocked there for a minute in the dark , erect above him , her other hand on his neck . The leather of her jeans creaked softly with the movement . Case shifted , feeling himself harden against the temper foam . His head throbbed , but the brittleness in his neck seemed to retreat . He raised himself on one elbow , rolled , sank back against the foam , pulling her down , licking her breasts , small hard nipples sliding wet across his cheek . He found the zip on the leather jeans and tugged it down . "
12661	12665	12466	12466	I	0	" she said , "
12670	12708	12466	12466	I	0	" Sound of the jeans peeling down . She struggled beside him until she could kick them away . She threw a leg across him and he touched her face . Unexpected hardness of the implanted lenses . "
12712	12716	12466	12466	I	0	" she said , "
12720	12849	12466	12466	I	0	" Now she straddled him again , took his hand , and closed it over her , his thumb along the cleft of her buttocks , his fingers spread across the labia . As she began to lower herself , the images came pulsing back , the faces , fragments of neon arriv- ing and receding . She slid down around him and his back arched convulsively . She rode him that way , impaling herself , slipping down on him again and again , until they both had come , his orgasm flaring blue in a timeless space , a vastness like the matrix , where the faces were shredded and blown away down hurricane corridors , and her inner thighs were strong and wet against his hips .

12915	12919	12920	12920	Ratz	272	" Not tonight . "

12991	13006	13007	13007	She	437	" Armitage wo n't like it , I let you out of my sight . "
13020	13073	13007	13007	She	437	" The guy wo n't talk to me if you 're there . Deane I do n't give two shits about . He takes care of himself . But I got people who 'll just go under if I walk out of Chiba cold . It 's my people , you know ? "
13083	13105	13106	13106	he	870	" I got people in Singapore , Tokyo connections in Shinjuku and Asakuza , and they 'll go down , understand ? "
13119	13131	13109	13109	his	870	" Five . Five minutes . By your clock , okay ? "
13132	13140	13109	13109	his	870	" Not what I 'm paid for . "
13141	13169	13109	13109	his	870	" What you 're paid for is one thing . Me letting some tight friends die because you 're too literal about your instructions is something else . "
13170	13191	13192	13192	She	437	" Bullshit . Tight friends my ass . You 're going in there to check us out with your smuggler . "
13207	13245	13192	13192	She	437	" Ah , Case , sport , it does look as though your companion there is definitely armed , aside from having a fair amount of silicon in her head . What is this about , exactly ? "
13260	13275	13246	13246	Deane	291	" Hold on , Julie . Anyway , I 'll be coming in alone . "
13276	13295	13109	13109	his	870	" You can be sure of that , old son . Would n't have it any other way . "
13296	13299	13300	13300	she	437	" Okay , "
13303	13338	13300	13300	she	437	" Go . But five Minutes . Any more and I 'll come in and cool your tight friend permanently . And while you 're at it , you try to figure something out . "
13339	13344	13109	13109	his	870	" What 's that ? "
13345	13354	13355	13355	She	437	" Why I 'm doing you the favor . "
13370	13379	13381	13381	Julie	291	" Keeping stranger company than usual , Case ? "
13383	13400	13381	13381	Julie	291	" Julie , she 's gone . You wanna let me in ? Please , Julie ? "
13405	13410	13109	13109	his	870	" Slowly , Case , "

13548	13565	13724	13724	He	291	" I need a history lesson , Julie . And a go - to on somebody . "

13594	13613	13724	13724	He	291	" Me , Julie . I 'm leaving . Gone . But do me the favor , okay ? "
13614	13624	13724	13724	He	291	" Go - to on whom , old son ? "
13625	13636	13637	13637	Deane	291	" Gaijin name of Armitage , suite in the Hilton . "
13643	13649	13650	13650	He	291	" Sit still , Case . "
13659	13723	13650	13650	He	291	" It seems as though you know as much as my net does , Case . This gentleman seems to have a temporary arrangement with the Yakuza , and the sons of the neon chrysanthemum have ways of screening their allies from the likes of me . I would n't have it any other way . Now , history . You said history . "
13740	13746	13724	13724	He	291	" What sort of history ? "
13747	13758	13724	13724	He	291	" The war . You in the war , Julie ? "
13759	13773	13724	13724	He	291	" The war ? What 's there to know ? Lasted three weeks . "
13774	13778	13724	13724	He	291	" Screaming Fist . "
13779	13883	13884	13884	Deane	291	" Famous . Do n't they teach you history these days ? Great bloody postwar political football , that was . Watergated all to hell and back . Your brass , Case , your Sprawlside brass in , where was it , McLean ? In the bunkers , all of that ... great scandal . Wasted a fair bit of patriotic young flesh in order to test some new technology . They knew about the Russians ' de- fenses , it came out later . Knew about the emps , magnetic pulse weapons . Sent these fellows in regardless , just to see . "
13887	13893	13884	13884	Deane	291	" Turkey shoot for Ivan . "

Just cheaper for them to kill her and take it . Save a little money .... I got the one who had the laser to tell me all about it . Coincidence we were here , but I had to make sure . "

16847	16906	16843	16843	Armitage	312	" You have fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of various main arteries , Case . They 're dissolving . Very slowly , but they definitely are dissolving . Each one contains a mycotoxin . You 're already familiar with the effect of that mycotoxin . It was the one your former employers gave you in Memphis . "
16915	17005	16907	16907	Case	274	" You have time to do what I 'm hiring you for , Case , but that 's all . Do the job and I can inject you with an enzyme that will dissolve the bond without opening the sacs . Then you 'll need a blood change . Otherwise , the sacs melt and you 're back where I found you . So you see , Case , you need us . You need us as badly as you did when we scraped you up from the gutter . "

But no , we got ta get us the Flatline and nothing else . Weird . "

28558	28567	28568	28569	the Finn	1009	" So that was where I came in , "
28572	28763	28568	28569	the Finn	1009	" Smith knew I dealt a lot with the Memory Lane crowd , and that 's where you go for a quiet go - to that 'll never be traced . I hired a cowboy . I was the cut - out , so I took a percentage . Smith , he was careful . He 'd just had a very weird business experience and he 'd come out on top , but it did n't add up . Who 'd paid , out of that Swiss stash ? Yakuza ? No way . They got a very rigid code covers situations like that , and they kill the receiver too , always . Was it spook stuff ? Smith did n't think so . Spook biz has a vibe , you get so you can smell it . Well , I had my cowboy buzz the news morgues until we found Tessier - Ashpool in litigation . The case was n't anything , but we got the law firm . Then he did the lawyer 's ice and we got the family address . Lotta good it did us . "

28777	28935	28773	28774	the Finn	1009	" The spindle . Turns out they own damn near the whole thing . The interesting stuff was the picture we got when the cowboy ran a regular go - to on the news morgues and compiled a precis . Family organization . Corporate structure . Supposedly you can buy into an S.A. , but there has n't been a share of Tessier - Ashpool traded on the open market in over a hundred years . On any market , as far as I know . You 're looking at a very quiet , very eccentric first - generation high- orbit family , run like a corporation . Big money , very shy of media . Lot of cloning . Orbital law 's a lot softer on genetic engineering , right ? And it 's hard to keep track of which gen- eration , or combination of generations , is running the show at a given time . "
28936	28941	28942	28942	Molly	437	" How 's that ? "
28945	28996	28942	28942	Molly	437	" Got their own cryogenic setup . Even under orbital law , you 're legally dead for the duration of a freeze . Looks like they trade off , though nobody 's seen the founding father in about thirty years . Founding momma , she died in some lab accident .... "

29014	29075	29076	29076	He	329	" Dropped it . We had a look at this fantastic tangle of powers of attorney the T - A 's have , and that was it . Jimmy must 've gotten into Straylight , lifted the head , and Tessier - Ashpool sent their ninja after it . Smith decided to forget about it . Maybe he was smart . "

33253	33270	33248	33248	he	379	" must take care . In Turkey there is disapproval of women who sport such modifications . "

33306	33319	33296	33296	She	437	" I know about you . Stool for the military , right ? "

33370	33401	33365	33365	She	437	" Maybe you get the explosives , lots of them , or maybe you get a cancer . One dart , shitface . You wo n't feel it for months . "
33402	33415	33365	33365	She	437	" Please . You call this in Ingiliz making me very tight .... "
33416	33438	33439	33439	She	437	" I call it a bad morning . Now tell us about your man and get your ass out of here . "
33445	33512	33439	33439	She	437	" He is living in Fener , at Kuchuk Gulhane Djaddesi 14 . 1 have his tunel route , nightly to the bazaar . He performs most recently at the Yenishehir Palas Oteli , a modem place in the style turistik , but it has been arranged that the police have shown a certain interest in these shows . The Yenishehir man- agement has grown nervous . "
33523	33532	33533	33533	she	437	" I want to know about the implants , "
33540	33551	33533	33533	she	437	" I want to know exactly what he can do . "
33555	33567	33568	33568	He	1383	" Worst is how you say in Ingiliz , the subliminals . "
33576	33581	33583	33584	the Mercedes	1348	" On our left , "
33596	33605	33583	33584	the Mercedes	1348	" is Kapali Carsi , the grand bazaar . "

33736	33771	33674	33675	the Finn	1009	" In Chiba City . He has no left lung . The other is boosted , is how you say it ? Anyone might buy these implants , but this one is most talented . "
33787	33831	33674	33675	the Finn	1009	" I have followed him in the street and seen a dozen cycles fall , near him , in a day . Find the cyclist in a hospital , the story is always the same . A scorpion poised beside a brake lever .... "
33832	33845	33846	33847	the Finn	1009	" ' What you see is what you get , ' yeah , "
33850	33887	33846	33847	the Finn	1009	" I seen the schematics on the guy 's silicon . Very flash . What he imagines , you see . I figure he could narrow it to a pulse and fry a retina over easy . "
33888	33898	33899	33899	Terzibashjian	379	" You have told this to your woman friend ? "
33907	33921	33922	33923	The Finn	329	" In Turkey , women are still women . This one . . . "
33926	33947	33922	33923	The Finn	329	" She 'd have you wearing your balls for a bow tie if you looked at her cross - eyed . "

34284	34298	34267	34268	the Finn	1009	" It 's a horse , man . You ever see a horse ? "
34347	34354	34355	34356	the Finn	1009	" Saw one in Maryland once , "
34359	34389	34355	34356	the Finn	1009	" and that was a good three years after the pandemic . There 's Arabs still trying to code 'em up from the DNA , but they always croak . "

34491	34520	34488	34488	he	1390	" he is moving . Each night he rides the tunel to the bazaar , to purchase his mixture from Ali . Your woman is close . Come . "

35323	35332	35333	35333	She	437	" So we 're through with you anyway . "
35342	35353	35354	35354	she	437	" Run into you again and I 'll kill you , "
35417	35423	35424	35424	he	638	" What is this thing ? "
35457	35469	35470	35470	she	437	" It was sort of a private whorehouse for the King , "
35477	35516	35470	35470	she	437	" Kept a lotta women there . Now it 's a museum . Kinda like Finn 's shop , all this stuff just jumbled in there big diamonds , swords , the left hand of John the Baptist .... "
35517	35524	35593	35593	her	437	" Like in a support vat ? "
35525	35578	35593	35593	her	437	" Nah . Dead . Got it inside this brass hand thing , little hatch on the side so the Christians could kiss it for luck . Got it off the Christians about a million years ago , and they never dust the goddam thing , 'cause it 's an infidel relic . "
35630	35641	35642	35642	she	437	" That Terzi , he 's grade - A scum , "
35645	35671	35642	35642	she	437	" He 's the secret police . Torturer . Real easy to buy out , too , with the kind of money Armitage was offering . "
35684	35692	35693	35693	Case	274	" I did that job for you , "
35696	35715	35693	35693	Case	274	" the one in London . I got something , but I do n't know what it means . "
35723	35744	35745	35745	She	437	" Well , I knew there was n't anybody name of Armitage in that Screaming Fist . Looked it up . "
35755	35772	35745	35745	She	437	" You figure the little computer pulled him out of it ? In that French hospital ? "
35773	35778	35779	35779	Case	274	" I figure Wintermute , "
35785	35789	35790	35790	he	274	" Thing is , "
35793	35830	35790	35790	he	274	" do you think he knows he was Corto , before ? I mean , he was n't anybody in particular , by the time he hit the ward , so maybe Wintermute just . . . "
35831	35842	35843	35843	She	437	" Yeah . Built him up from go . Yeah ... "
35850	35923	35843	35843	She	437	" It figures . You know , the guy does n't have any life going , in private . Not as far as I can tell . You see a guy like that , you figure there 's something he does when he 's alone . But not Armitage . Sits and stares at the wall , man . Then something clicks and he goes into high gear and wheels for Wintermute . "
35924	35937	35790	35790	he	274	" So why 's he got that stash in London ? Nostalgia ? "
35938	35947	35948	35948	she	437	" Maybe he does n't know about it , "
35951	35962	35948	35948	she	437	" Maybe it 's just in his name , right ? "
35963	35970	35971	35971	Case	274	" I do n't get it , "
35974	35988	35971	35971	Case	274	" Just thinking out loud .... How smart 's an Al , Case ? "
35989	36025	35790	35790	he	274	" Depends . Some are n't much smarter than dogs . Pets . Cost a fortune anyway . The real smart ones are as smart as the Turing heat is willing to let 'em get . "
36026	36047	35948	35948	she	437	" Look , you 're a cowboy . How come you are n't just flat- out fascinated with those things ? "
36048	36051	36052	36052	he	274	" Well , "
36055	36106	36052	36052	he	274	" for starts , they 're rare . Most of them are military , the bright ones , and we ca n't crack the ice . That 's where ice all comes from , you know ? And then there 's the Turing cops , and that 's bad heat . "
36112	36125	36107	36107	He	274	" I dunno , it just is n't part of the trip . "
36126	36132	36133	36133	she	437	" Jockeys all the same , "
36136	36140	36133	36133	she	437	" No imagination . "
36171	36176	36177	36177	she	437	" That 's Wintermute , "
36180	36238	36177	36177	she	437	" This deal 's real big , looks to me . We 're out where the little waves are too broad , we ca n't see the rock that hit the center . We know something 's there , but not why . I wanna know why . I want you to go and talk to Wintermute . "
36239	36247	36248	36248	he	274	" I could n't get near it , "
36251	36256	36248	36248	he	274	" You 're dreaming . "
36257	36260	36177	36177	she	437	" Try . "
36261	36267	36177	36177	she	437	" Ca n't be done . "
36268	36273	36248	36248	he	274	" Ask the Flatline . "
36274	36284	36285	36285	he	274	" What do we want out of that Riviera ? "
36300	36432	36294	36294	She	437	" God knows . I 'd as soon kill him as look at him . I saw his profile . He 's a kind of compulsive Judas . Ca n't get off sexually unless he knows he 's betraying the object of desire . That 's what the file says . And they have to love him first . Maybe he loves them , too . That 's why it was easy for Terzi to set him up for us , because he 's been here three years , shopping politicals to the secret police . Probably Terzi let him watch , when the cattle prods came out . He 's done eighteen in three years . All women age twenty to twenty - five . It kept Terzi in dissidents . "
36442	36501	36433	36433	She	1469	" Because if he found one he really wanted , he 'd make sure she turned political . He 's got a personality like a Modern 's suit . The profile said it was a very rare type , estimated one in a couple of million . Which anyway says something good about human nature , I guess . "
36517	36535	36502	36502	She	1469	" I think I 'm going to have to buy myself some special insurance on that Peter . "
36548	36554	36537	36537	she	1469	" What 's that mean ? "
36555	36604	36502	36502	She	1469	" Never mind . Let 's go back to Beyoglu and find something like breakfast . I got ta busy night again , tonight . Got ta collect his stuff from that apartment in Fener , got ta go back to the bazaar and buy him some drugs .... "
36605	36616	36617	36617	She	1469	" Buy him some drugs ? How 's he rate ? "
36620	36659	36660	36660	She	1469	" He 's not dying on the wire , sweetheart . And it looks like he ca n't work without that special taste . I like you better now , anyway , you are n't so goddam skinny . "
36663	36679	36660	36660	She	1469	" So I 'll go to Ali the dealer and stock up . You betcha . "
36690	36695	36696	36696	he	312	" Time to pack , "
36769	36774	36775	36775	he	274	" Where to now ? "
36789	36795	36775	36775	he	274	" What kind of climate ? "
36796	36806	36807	36807	Armitage	312	" They do n't have climate , just weather , "
36810	36817	36818	36818	He	274	" Here . Read the brochure . "
36828	36840	36818	36818	He	274	" Did Riviera check out okay ? Where 's the Finn ? "
36841	36854	36855	36855	Armitage	312	" Riviera 's fine . The Finn is on his way home . "
36888	36912	36878	36878	he	312	" Do n't get too smart . Those little sacs are starting to show wear , but you do n't know how much . "
37300	37311	37312	37312	he	274	" I bet you 're stoned right now , asshole , "
37370	37375	37376	37376	he	274	" See ya lady , "
37479	37482	37474	37474	he	274	" Yeah ? "
37502	37507	37474	37474	he	274	" Hello . Case . "
37529	37540	37474	37474	he	274	" Wintermute , Case . It 's time we talk . "
37547	37557	37558	37558	He	274	" Do n't you want to talk , Case ? "
37838	37875	37826	37826	Molly	437	" No , baby . No games . You play that subliminal shit around me , I 'll hurt you real bad . I can do it without damaging you at all . I like that . "
37902	37912	37913	37913	Case	274	" That 's right , Peter . Do n't . "
37970	37979	37980	37980	Molly	437	" You been up , have n't you ? "
37999	38010	38011	38012	The steward	1519	" Nah . Never travel much , just for biz . "
38024	38032	38033	38033	she	437	" Hope you do n't get SAS , "
38036	38042	38033	38033	she	437	" Airsick ? No way . "
38043	38092	38093	38094	The steward	1519	" It 's not the same . Your heartbeat'll speed up in zero - g , and your inner ear'll go nuts for a while . Kicks in your flight reflex , like you 'll be getting signals to run like hell , and a lot of adrenaline . "
38268	38304	38246	38247	The steward	1519	" he asked , eyeing a shred of Yeheyuan tobacco that had drifted gracefully up out of his shirt pocket to dance ten centimeters from his nose . There was no smoking on shuttle flights . "
38334	38355	38322	38322	We	1527	" She touched the release plate on her harness and began to free herself from the embrace of the foam . "

44930	45055	44920	44920	Deane	291	" Well , Case , all I can say to that , and I really do n't have nearly as many answers as you imagine I do , is that what you think of as Wintermute is only a part of another , a , shall we say , potential entity . I , let us say , am merely one aspect of that entity 's brain . It 's rather like dealing , from your point of view , with a man whose lobes have been severed . Let 's say you 're dealing with a small part of the man 's left brain . Difficult to say if you 're dealing with the man at all , in a case like that . "
45059	45078	44920	44920	Deane	291	" Is the Corto story true ? You got to him through a micro in that French hospital ? "
45079	45200	44920	44920	Deane	291	" Yes . And I assembled the file you accessed in London . I try to plan . in your sense of the word , but that is n't my basic mode , really . I improvise . It 's my greatest talent . I prefer situations to plans , you see .... Really , I 've had to deal with givens . I can sort a great deal of information , and sort it very quickly . It 's taken a very long time to assemble the team you 're a part of . Corto was the first , and he very nearly did n't make it . Very far gone , in Toulon . Eating , excreting , and mastur-

50750	50756	50736	50736	Molly	437	" Who else , honey ? "
50763	50772	50736	50736	Molly	437	" The mirrors followed him across the room . "
50780	50800	50736	50736	Molly	437	" he said , taking a tightly rolled strip of bubble - packed blue derms from his shirt pocket . "

50996	51001	50983	50983	you	1761	" He looked down . "
51011	51015	50983	50983	you	1761	" She laughed . "

51027	51040	50983	50983	you	1761	" he said , climbing into the sand - colored tem- perfoam , "
51050	51050	50983	50983	you	1761	"
51052	51061	51062	51062	Armitage	312	" Case , what 's wrong with you ? "
51128	51135	51111	51111	He	434	" Something I ate , maybe . "
51136	51146	51147	51147	Armitage	312	" I want you checked out by a medic , "
51150	51156	51147	51147	Armitage	312	" Just this hystamine reaction , "
51160	51173	51157	51157	Case	274	" Get it when I travel , eat different stuff , sometimes . "
51204	51211	51212	51212	he	312	" I 've ordered for you , "
51254	51257	51258	51258	Molly	437	" Jesus , "
51266	51276	51277	51277	She	437	" gimme that . You know what this costs ? "
51304	51313	51277	51277	She	437	" She forked a mouthful up and chewed . "
51317	51369	51277	51277	She	437	" Case managed . His brain was deep - fried . No , he decided , it had been thrown into hot fat and left there and the fat had cooled , a thick dull grease congealing on the wrinkled lobes , shot through with greenish - purple flashes of pain . "
51375	51401	51370	51370	You	274	" Molly said cheerfully . Case tried the wine . The aftermath of the betaphenethylam- ine made it taste like iodine . The lights dimmed . "
51407	51418	51370	51370	You	274	" said a disembodied voice with a pronounced Sprawl accent , "
51430	51480	51426	51428	Mr. Peter Riviera	393	" Scattered applause from the other tables . A waiter lit a single candle and placed it in the center of their table , then began to remove the dishes . Soon a candle flickered at each of the restaurant 's dozen tables , and drinks were being poured . "
51485	51504	51426	51428	Mr. Peter Riviera	393	" Case asked Armitage , who said noth- ing . Molly picked her teeth with a burgundy nail . "
51508	51649	51370	51370	You	274	" Riviera said , stepping forward on a small stage at the far end of the room . Case blinked . In his discomfort , he had n't noticed the stage . He had n't seen where Riviera had come from . His uneasiness increased . At first he assumed the man was illuminated by a spotlight . Riviera glowed . The light clung around him like a skin , lit the dark hangings behind the stage . He was projecting . Riviera smiled . He wore a white dinner jacket . On his lapel , blue coals burned in the depths of a black carnation . His fin- gernails flashed as he raised his hands in a gesture of greeting , an embrace for his audience . Case heard the shallow water lap against the side of the restaurant . "
51652	51661	51662	51662	I	0	" Riviera said , his long eyes shining , "
51677	51719	51662	51662	I	0	" A cool ruby of light formed in the palm of his upraised right hand . He dropped it . A gray dove fluttered up from the point of impact and vanished into the shadows . Someone whistled . More applause . "
51731	51737	51727	51728	The Doll	1772	" Riviera lowered his hands . "
51758	51779	51749	51756	Lady 3Jane Marie - France Tessier - Ashpool	437	" A wave of polite ap- plause . As it died , Riviera 's eyes seemed to find their table . "
51785	51935	51782	51783	another lady	1773	" The restaurant 's lights died entirely , for a few seconds , leaving only the glow of candles . Riviera 's holographic aura had faded with the lights , but Case could still see him , standing with his head bowed . Lines of faint light began to form , verticals and horizontals , sketching an open cube around the stage . The restaurant 's lights had come back up slightly , but the framework surrounding the stage might have been constructed of frozen moonbeams . Head bowed , eyes closed , arms rigid at his sides , Riviera seemed to quiver with concentration . Suddenly the ghostly cube was filled , had become a room , a room lacking its fourth wall , allowing the audience to view its contents . Riviera seemed to relax slightly . He raised his head , but kept his eyes closed . "
51944	51948	51936	51936	I	0	" he said . "
51961	52055	51949	51949	I	0	" The room 's walls were yellowed white plaster . It contained two pieces of furniture . One was a plain wooden chair , the other an iron bedstead painted white . The paint had chipped and flaked , revealing the black iron . The mattress on the bed was bare . Stained ticking with faded brown stripes . A single bulb dangled above the bed on a twisted length of black wire . Case could see the thick coating of dust on the bulb 's upper curve . Riviera opened his eyes . "
52066	52090	52056	52056	I	0	" He sat on the chair , facing the bed . The blue coals still burned in the black flower on his lapel . "
52104	52108	52096	52096	I	0	" he said , "
52125	52138	52116	52116	she	1777	" There was something on the bed . Case blinked . Gone . "
52164	52198	52199	52199	I	0	" His voice carried perfectly in the hush of the restaurant . Ice clicked against the side of a glass . Someone giggled . Someone else asked a whispered ques- tion in Japanese . "
52230	52825	52826	52826	He	1778	" A woman 's hand lay on the mattress now , palm up , the white fingers pale . Riviera leaned forward , picked up the hand , and began to stroke it gently . The fingers moved . Riviera raised the hand to his mouth and began to lick the tips of the fingers . The nails were coated with a burgundy lacquer . A hand , Case saw , but not a severed hand ; the skin swept back smoothly , unbroken and unscarred . He remembered a tattooed lozenge of vatgrown flesh in the window of a Ninsei surgical boutique . Riviera was holding the hand to his lips , licking its palm . The fingers tentatively caressed his face . But now a second hand lay on the bed . When Riviera reached for it , the fingers of the first were locked around his wrist , a bracelet of flesh and bone . The act progressed with a surreal internal logic of its own . The arms were next . Feet . Legs . The legs were very beautiful . Case 's head throbbed . His throat was dry . He drank the last of the wine . Riviera was in the bed now , naked . His clothing had been a part of the projection , but Case could n't remember seeing it fade away . The black flower lay at the foot of the bed , still seething with its blue inner flame . Then the torso formed , as Riviera caressed it into being , white , headless , and perfect , sheened with the faintest gloss of sweat . Molly 's body . Case stared , his mouth open . But it was n't Molly ; it was Molly as Riviera imagined her . The breasts were wrong , the nipples larger , too dark . Riviera and the limbless torso writhed together on the bed , crawled over by the hands with their bright nails . The bed was thick now with folds of yellowed , rotting lace that crumbled at a touch . Motes of dust boiled around Riviera and the twitching limbs , the scurrying , pinching , caressing hands . Case glanced at Molly . Her face was blank ; the colors of Riviera 's projection heaved and turned in her mirrors . Armitage was leaning forward , his hands round the stem of a wineglass , his pale eyes fixed on the stage , the glowing room . Now limbs and torso had merged , and Riviera shuddered . The head was there , the image complete . Molly 's face , with smooth quicksilver drowning the eyes . Riviera and the Molly- image began to couple with a renewed intensity . Then the image slowly extended a clawed hand and extruded its five blades . With a languorous , dreamlike deliberation , it raked Riviera 's bare back . Case caught a glimpse of exposed spine , but he was already up and stumbling for the door . He vomited over a rosewood railing into the quiet waters of the lake . Something that had seemed to close around his head like a vise had released him now . Kneeling , his cheek against the cool wood , he stared across the shallow lake at the bright aura of the Rue Jules Verne . Case had seen the medium before ; when he 'd been a teenager in the Sprawl , they 'd called it , '' dreaming real . "
52985	52990	52991	52991	Case	274	" Where is she ? "
52994	52997	52998	52998	Armitage	312	" Gone , "
53001	53007	52998	52998	Armitage	312	" She go after him ? "
53008	53011	52998	52998	Armitage	312	" No . "
53065	53074	53052	53052	Case	274	" Tell me where she went , Armitage . "
53092	53115	53080	53080	Case	274	" She 's gone to prepare herself . You wo n't see her again . You 'll be together during the run . "
53116	53125	53126	53126	Armitage	312	" Why did Riviera do that to her ? "
53136	53143	53126	53126	Armitage	312	" Get some sleep , Case . "
53144	53150	53151	53151	Armitage	312	" We run , tomorrow ? "
53474	53484	53485	53485	he	274	" Get me a number for the Marcus Garvey , "
53490	53502	53485	53485	he	274	" It 's a tug , registered out of Zion cluster . "
53513	53516	53485	53485	he	274	" Sir , "
53519	53527	53528	53528	Maelcum	409	" the registration in question is Panamanian . "

53539	53549	53528	53528	Maelcum	409	" Case . You got a modem , Maelcum ? "

53563	53596	53528	53528	Maelcum	409	" Can you get it off for me , man ? Put it on my Hosaka . Then turn my deck on . It 's the stud with the ridges on it . "
53597	53606	53528	53528	Maelcum	409	" How you doin' in there , mon ? "
53607	53615	53528	53528	Maelcum	409	" Well , I need some help . "
53616	53628	53528	53528	Maelcum	409	" Movin ' , mon . I get th ' modem . "

53697	53702	53703	53704	The Flatline	1259	" Hey , Case . "
53720	53795	53703	53704	The Flatline	1259	" Dix , you 're about to punch your way in here and get something for me . You can be as blunt as you want . Molly 's in here somewhere and I wanna know where . I 'm in 335W , the Intercontinental . She was registered here too , but I do n't know what name she was using . Ride in on this phone and do their records for me . "
53796	53801	53802	53803	the Flatline	1259	" No sooner said , "
53818	53844	53815	53815	He	274	" Done . Rose Kolodny . Checked out . Take me a few minutes to screw their security net deep enough to get a fix . "

54246	54350	54235	54235	Case	274	" But I did n't . What 's it matter , though ? How much does it really matter to Mr. Case ? Quit kidding yourself . I know your Linda , man . I know all the Lindas .

54467	54483	54464	54464	Case	274	" Tell the Hosaka to tell Maelcum to disconnect the modem . Thanks , Dix . "

54737	54744	54745	54745	He	274	" We 'll wait , yeah . "
54751	54770	54745	54745	He	274	" That last part of the address , I think that 's a cubicle . Number forty- three . "
54771	54777	54778	54778	Cath	433	" You expected , Lupus ? "
54796	54800	54801	54801	Case	274	" Not really , "
54804	54810	54801	54801	Case	274	" That 's a problem ? "
54811	54844	54845	54845	She	433	" Just go down to the lowest level and find your friend 's cubicle . If they let you in , fine . If they do n't wanna see you . . . "
54946	54949	54950	54950	he	274	" Downstairs , "
54957	54964	54965	54965	He	274	" I want to go downstairs . "
55002	55008	55009	55009	he	274	" I want a cubicle , "
55027	55031	55032	55032	He	274	" Lower level . "
55038	55042	55043	55043	She	1835	" Gender preference ? "
55058	55061	55062	55062	he	274	" Female , "
55066	55092	55062	55062	he	274	" Number thirty - five . Phone if it is n't satisfactory . You can access our special services display beforehand , if you like . "
55334	55338	55339	55339	she	1715	" Jesus Christ , "
55352	55376	55377	55377	She	1715	" You 're an idiot to try that . How the hell you open those locks , Case ? Case ? You okay ? "
55382	55385	55386	55386	he	274	" Chip , "
55411	55419	55400	55400	She	1715	" You bribe the help , upstairs ? "
55430	55452	55453	55453	He	274	" Breathe in . Count . One , two , three , four . Hold it . Now out . Count . "
55458	55463	55464	55464	he	274	" You kicked me , "
55467	55483	55464	55464	he	274	" Shoulda been lower . I wanna be alone . I 'm meditating , right ? "
55489	55495	55496	55496	She	1715	" And getting a briefing . "
55510	55519	55496	55496	She	1715	" Win- termute 's telling me about Straylight . "
55520	55527	55496	55496	She	1715	" Where 's the meat puppet ? "
55528	55544	55545	55545	She	1715	" There is n't any . That 's the most expensive special service of all . "
55560	55569	55551	55551	her	1715	" The run 's tomorrow , Wintermute says . "
55570	55586	55496	55496	She	1715	" What was that all about , in the restaurant ? How come you ran ? "
55587	55601	55496	55496	She	1715	" 'Cause , if I 'd stayed , I might have killed Riviera . "
55602	55605	55551	55551	her	1715	" Why ? "
55606	55616	55496	55496	She	1715	" What he did to me . The show . "
55617	55624	55496	55496	She	1715	" I do n't get it . "
55625	55631	55632	55632	she	1715	" This cost a lot , "
55657	55783	55784	55784	She	1715	" Costs to go to Chiba , costs to get the surgery , costs to have them jack your nervous system up so you 'll have the reflexes to go with the gear .... You know how I got the money , when I was starting out ? Here . Not here , but a place like it , in the Sprawl . Joke , to start with , 'cause once they plant the cut - out chip , it seems like free money . Wake up sore , sometimes , but that 's it . Renting the goods , is all . You are n't in , when it 's all happening . House has software for whatever a customer wants to pay for .... "
55789	55844	55845	55845	She	1715	" Fine . I was getting my money . Trouble was , the cut - out and the circuitry the Chiba clinics put in were n't com- patible . So the worktime started bleeding in , and I could re- member it .... But it was just bad dreams , and not all bad . "
55848	55855	55845	55845	She	1715	" Then it started getting strange . "
55867	55908	55856	55856	She	1715	" The house found out what I was doing with the money . I had the blades in , but the fine neuromotor work would take another three trips . No way I was ready to give up puppet time . "
55926	55984	55909	55909	She	1715	" So the bastard who ran the place , he had some custom software cooked up . Berlin , that 's the place for snuff , you know ? Big market for mean kicks , Berlin . I never knew who wrote the program they switched me to , but it was based on all the classics . "
55985	56005	55909	55909	She	1715	" They knew you were picking up on this stuff ? That you were conscious while you were working ? "
56006	56078	56079	56079	She	1850	" I was n't conscious . It 's like cyberspace , but blank . Silver . It smells like rain .... You can see yourself orgasm , it 's like a little nova right out on the rim of space . But I was starting to remember . Like dreams , you know . And they did n't tell me . They switched the software and started renting to specialty markets . "
56087	56164	56079	56079	She	1850	" And I knew , but I kept quiet about it . I needed the money . The dreams got worse and worse , and I 'd tell myself that at least some of them were just dreams , but by then I 'd started to figure that the boss had a whole little clientele going for me . Nothing 's too good for Molly , the boss says , and gives me this shit raise . "
56170	56191	56167	56167	her	1850	" That prick was charging eight times what he was paying me , and he thought I did n't know . "
56192	56200	56079	56079	She	1850	" So what was he charging for ? "
56201	56224	56225	56225	She	1850	" Bad dreams . Real ones . One night . . . one night , I 'd just come back from Chiba . "
56246	56280	56281	56281	She	1850	" Surgeons went way in , that trip . Tricky . They must have disturbed the cut - out chip . I came up . I was into this routine with a customer .... "
56290	56320	56321	56321	She	1850	" Senator , he was . Knew his fat face right away . We were both covered with blood . We were n't alone . She was all . .. "
56327	56356	56321	56321	She	1850	" Dead . And that fat prick , he was saying , ' What 's wrong . What 's wrong ? ' 'Cause we were n't finished yet .... "
56362	56378	56357	56357	She	1850	" So I guess I gave the Senator what he really wanted , you know ? "
56397	56416	56389	56389	her	1850	" The house put a con- tract out on me . I had to hide for a while . "
56422	56431	56432	56432	she	1850	" So Riviera hit a nerve last night , "
56435	56460	56432	56432	she	1850	" I guess it wants me to hate him real bad , so I 'll be psyched up to go in there after him . "
56461	56465	56515	56515	She	1850	" After him ? "
56466	56498	56499	56499	Case	274	" He 's already there . Straylight . On the invitation of Lady 3Jane , all that dedication shit . She was there in a private box , kinda . . . "
56507	56514	56515	56515	She	1850	" You gon na kill him ? "
56520	56531	56515	56515	She	1850	" He 's going to die , yeah . Soon . "
56532	56539	56540	56540	he	274	" I had a visit too , "
56565	56575	56562	56562	She	1850	" Maybe it wants you to hate something too . "
56576	56582	56553	56556	the Zone - figure	1851	" Maybe I hate it . "
56583	56591	56562	56562	She	1850	" Maybe you hate yourself , Case . "
56592	56597	56598	56598	Bruce	434	" How was it ? "
56608	56613	56614	56614	he	434	" Try it sometime , "
56621	56635	56614	56614	he	434	" Just ca n't see you the kinda guy goes for the puppets , "
56648	56656	56657	56657	Bruce	434	" Can we go home , now ? "
56660	56674	56657	56657	Bruce	434	" Sure . Drop me down Jules Verne , where the bars are . "
57257	57260	57261	57261	he	274	" Numb , "
57331	57334	57335	57335	He	274	" Gangster . "
57360	57366	57367	57367	he	274	" Thought you went home , "
57381	57396	57367	57367	he	274	" I got him to drop me off at this shop . Bought this . "
57420	57424	57411	57411	He	274	" Like it ? "
57425	57428	57429	57429	He	274	" Sure . "
57443	57455	57429	57429	He	274	" What do you think you 're up to , honey ? "
57456	57468	57469	57469	She	433	" You like the beta you got off us , Lupus ? "
57508	57513	57497	57497	She	433	" You get off ? "
57514	57524	57429	57429	He	274	" Yeah . But the comedown 's a bitch . "
57525	57532	57469	57469	She	433	" Then you need another one . "
57533	57543	57497	57497	She	433	" And what 's that supposed to lead to ? "
57544	57576	57429	57429	He	274	" I got a key . Up the hill behind the Paradise , just the cream- iest crib . People down the well on business tonight , if you follow me .... "
57577	57583	57584	57584	She	433	" If I follow you . "
57597	57614	57584	57584	She	433	" You 're Yak , are n't you , Lupus ? Gaijin soldierman for the Yakuza . "
57615	57623	57624	57624	He	1874	" You got an eye , huh ? "
57634	57659	57624	57624	He	1874	" How come you got all your fingers , then ? I thought you had to chop one off every time you screwed up . "
57660	57666	57667	57667	He	1874	" I never screw up . "
57672	57693	57667	57667	He	1874	" I saw that girl you 're with . Day I met you . Walks like Hideo . Scares me . "
57699	57710	57694	57694	She	1875	" I like that . She like it with girls ? "
57711	57719	57667	57667	He	1874	" Never said . Who 's Hideo ? "
57720	57734	57735	57735	Case	274	" 3Jane 's , what she calls it , retainer . Family retainer . "
57749	57754	57746	57746	he	1874	" Dee - Jane ? "
57755	57771	57735	57735	Case	274	" Lady 3Jane . She 's triff . Rich . Her father owns all this . "
57772	57776	57806	57806	his	274	" This bar ? "
57777	57780	57746	57746	he	1874	" Freeside ! "
57781	57794	57795	57795	He	274	" No shit . You keepin ' some class company , huh ? "
57812	57842	57801	57801	his	274	" So how you meet these aristos , Cathy ? You some kinda closet deb ? You an ' Bruce secret heirs to some ripe old credit ? Huh ? "
57864	57870	57871	57871	she	1877	" Oh , you know , "
57889	57935	57871	57871	she	1877	" she likes to party . Bruce and I , we make the party circuit .... It gets real boring for her , in there . Her old man lets her out sometimes , as long as she brings Hideo to take care of her . "
57936	57944	57951	57951	She	1877	" Where 's it get boring ? ' "
57981	57988	57951	57951	She	1877	" She snuggled in against him . "
58006	58069	58070	58070	Hideo	453	" She wore a tiny leather purse on a slender neck - thong . Her nails were bright pink against her boosted tan , bitten to the quick . She opened the purse and withdrew a paperbacked bub- ble with a blue derm inside . Something white tumbled to the floor ; Case stooped and picked it up . An origami crane . "
58076	58080	58081	58081	He	1883	" she said . "
58103	58138	58141	58141	she	1884	" She tucked the folded paper back into her purse . Case watched as she tore the bubble away , peeled the derm from its backing , and smoothed it across his inner wrist . "
58153	58162	58141	58141	she	1884	" He watched his hands fumble an outline . "
58168	58169	58170	58170	I	0	" "
58187	58307	58174	58174	she	1884	" The drug hit him like an express train , a white - hot column of light mounting his spine from the region of his prostate , illuminating the sutures of his skull with x - rays of short - cir- cuited sexual energy . His teeth sang in their individual sockets like tuning forks , each one pitch - perfect and clear as ethanol . His bones , beneath the hazy envelope of flesh , were chromed and polished , the joints lubricated with a film of silicone . Sand- storms raged across the scoured floor of his skull , generating waves of high thin static that broke behind his eyes , spheres of purest crystal , expanding .... "
58311	58319	58320	58320	You	0	" she said , taking his hand . "
58340	58471	58473	58473	you	0	" The anger was expanding , relentless , exponential , riding out behind the betaphenethylamine rush like a carrier wave , a seismic fluid , rich and corrosive . His erection was a bar of lead . The faces around them in Emergency were painted doll things , the pink and white of mouth parts moving , moving , words emerging like discrete balloons of sound . He looked at Cath and saw each pore in the tanned skin , eyes flat as dumb glass , a tint of dead metal , a faint bloating , the most minute asymmetries of breast and collarbone , the -- something flared white behind his eyes . He dropped her hand and stumbled for the door , shoving someone out of the way . "
58475	58481	58473	58473	you	0	" she screamed behind him , "
58486	58708	58482	58482	you	0	" He could n't feel his legs . He used them like stilts , swaying crazily across the flagstone pavement of Jules Verne , a distant rumbling in his ears , his own blood , razored sheets of light bisecting his skull at a dozen angles . And then he was frozen , erect , fists tight against his thighs , head back , his lips curled , shaking . While he watched the loser 's zodiac of Freeside , the nightclub constellations of the hologram sky , shift , sliding fluid down the axis of darkness , to swarm like live things at the dead center of reality . Until they had arranged themselves , individually and in their hundreds , to form a vast simple portrait , stippled the ultimate mono- chrome , stars against night sky . Face of Miss Linda Lee . When he was able to look away , to lower his eyes , he found every other face in the street upraised , the strolling tourists becalmed with wonder . And when the lights in the sky went out , a ragged cheer went up from Jules Verne , to echo off the terraces and ranked balconies of lunar concrete . Somewhere a clock began to chime , some ancient bell out of Europe . Midnight .
59004	59007	59008	59008	she	1715	" Turing , "
59011	59017	59008	59008	she	1715	" You are under arrest . "
59025	59033	59034	59034	She	1715	" Your name is Henry Dorsett Case . "
59064	59070	59071	59071	He	1887	" You been here awhile ? "
59108	59113	59114	59116	The two men	1900	" Where is Kolodny ? "
59171	59176	59163	59164	the surgeons	1901	" Who 's Kolodny ? "
59177	59190	59228	59229	The girl	1715	" That was the name in the register . Where is she ? "
59191	59195	59196	59196	he	1887	" I dunno , "
59212	59217	59196	59196	he	1887	" She took off . "
59218	59227	59228	59229	The girl	1715	" Where did you go tonight , Case ? "
59248	59263	59228	59229	The girl	1715	" Jules Verne , couple of bars , got high . How about you ? "
59277	59287	59289	59293	the man on the left	1903	" I do n't think you grasp your situation , "
59310	59332	59333	59333	He	1903	" You are busted , Mr. Case . The charges have to do with conspiracy to augment an artificial intelli- gence . "
59349	59360	59333	59333	He	1903	" The man you call Armitage is already in custody . "
59361	59364	59365	59366	The man	638	" Corto ? "
59371	59384	59365	59366	The man	638	" Yes . How do you know that that is his name ? "
59394	59398	59399	59399	Case	274	" I forget , "
59402	59407	59408	59409	the girl	1715	" You 'll remember , "
59607	59620	59621	59621	Roland	457	" You say you were hired to make a run , Case , "
59632	59682	59683	59683	He	457	" and that you are unaware of the nature of the target . Is this not unusual in your trade ? Having penetrated the defenses , would you not be unable then to perform the required operation ? And surely an operation of some kind is required , yes ? "
59733	59741	59742	59742	he	274	" Can I put some clothes on ? "
59799	59802	59803	59803	he	458	" Non , "
59842	59845	59846	59846	he	457	" Look , "
59849	59895	59846	59846	he	457	" I 'm sick . Had this godawful drug in a bar , you know ? I wanna lie down . You got me already . You say you got Armitage . You got him , go ask him . I 'm just hired help . "
59899	59903	59896	59896	Roland	457	" And Kolodny ? "
59904	59931	59846	59846	he	457	" She was with Armitage when he hired me . Just muscle , a razorgirl . Far as I know . Which is n't too far . "
59932	59943	59944	59944	Pierre	458	" You know that Armitage 's real name is Corto , "
59960	59970	59944	59944	Pierre	458	" How do you know that , my friend ? "
59971	59979	59980	59980	Case	274	" I guess he mentioned it sometime , "
59987	59999	59980	59980	Case	274	" Everybody 's got a couple names . Your name Pierre ? "
60000	60010	60011	60011	Michele	328	" We know how you were repaired in Chiba , "
60014	60025	60011	60011	Michele	328	" and that may have been Wintermute 's first mistake . "
60044	60069	59980	59980	Case	274	" The process employed on you resulted in the clinic 's owner applying for seven basic patents . Do you know what that means ? "
60070	60073	60011	60011	Michele	328	" No . "
60074	60114	60115	60115	She	1912	" It means that the operator of a black clinic in Chiba City now owns a controlling interest in three major medical research consortiums . This reverses the usual order of things , you see . It attracted attention . "
60191	60262	60188	60188	her	1912	" Traced you to the Sprawl , lost you again , then caught up with you as you were leaving for Istanbul . We backtracked , traced you through the grid , determined that you 'd instigated a riot at Sense / Net . Sense / Net was eager to cooperate . They ran an inventory for us . They discovered that McCoy Pauley 's ROM personality construct was missing . "
60263	60267	60268	60268	Roland	457	" In Istanbul , "
60274	60292	60268	60268	Roland	457	" it was very easy . The woman had alienated Armitage 's contact with the secret police . "
60293	60300	60301	60301	Pierre	458	" And then you came here , "
60313	60318	60301	60301	Pierre	458	" We were delighted . "
60319	60327	60268	60268	Roland	457	" Chance to work on your tan ? "
60328	60335	60336	60336	Michele	328	" You know what we mean , "
60339	60447	60336	60336	Michele	328	" If you wish to pretend that you do not , you only make things more difficult for yourself . There is still the matter of extradition . You will return with us , Case , as will Armitage . But where , exactly , will we all be going ? To Switzerland , where you will be merely a pawn in the trial of an artificial intelligence ?

The face of the Kuang logics kinda sleazes up to the target and mutates , so it gets to be exactly like the ice fabric . Then we lock on and the main programs cut in , start talking circles ' round the logics in the ice . We go Siamese twin on 'em before they even get restless . "

65865	65888	65857	65857	she	1987	" you lis- tening ? Tell you a story .... Had me this boy once . You kinda remind me . . . "
65896	65903	65889	65889	She	1987	" Johnny , his name was . "
66078	66155	66156	66156	Her	1987	" My Johnny , see , he was smart , real flash boy . Started out as a stash on Memory Lane , chips in his head and people paid to hide data there . Had the Yak after him , night I met him , and I did for their assassin . More luck than anything else , but I did for him . And after that , it was tight and sweet , Case . "
66178	66264	66265	66265	She	2003	" We had a set - up with a squid , so we could read the traces of everything he 'd ever stored . Ran it all out on tape and started twisting selected clients , ex - clients . I was bagman , muscle , watchdog . I was real happy . You ever been happy , Case ? He was my boy . We worked together . Partners . I was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house when I met him .... "
66294	66397	66265	66265	She	2003	" Tight , sweet , just ticking along , we were . Like nobody could ever touch us . I was n't going to let them . Yakuza , I guess , they still wanted Johnny 's ass . 'Cause I 'd killed their man . 'Cause Johnny'd burned them . And the Yak , they can afford to move so fucking slow , man , they 'll wait years and years . Give you a whole life , just so you 'll have more to lose when they come and take it away . Patient like a spider . Zen spiders . "
66506	66578	66579	66579	Her	0	" So that first one they 'd sent , he 'd been hot . Reflexes like you never saw , implants , enough style for ten ordinary hoods . But the second one , he was , I dunno , like a monk . Cloned . Stone killer from the cells on up . Had it in him , death , this silence , he gave it off in a cloud .... "
66597	66734	66592	66592	She	0	" One time , I was a little kid , we were squatting . It was down by the Hudson , and those rats , man , they were big . It 's the chemicals get into them . Big as I was , and all night one had been scrabbling under the floor of the squat . Round dawn somebody brought this old man in , seams down his cheeks and his eyes all red . Had a roll of greasy leather like you 'd keep steel tools in , to keep the rust off . Spread it out , had this old revolver and three shells . Old man , he puts one bullet in there , then he starts walking up and down the squat , we 're hanging back by the walls . "
66814	66829	66830	66830	She	2015	" I crawled under there later . Rat had a hole between its eyes . "
66844	66877	66830	66830	She	2015	" The second one , the one who came for Johnny , he was like that old man . Not old , but he was like that . He killed that way . "
66931	67088	66920	66920	She	2015	" I just saw him once . On my way into our place . He was coming out . We lived in a converted factory space , lots of young comers from Sense / Net , like that . Pretty good security to start with , and I 'd put in some really heavy stuff to make it really tight . I knew Johnny was up there . But this little guy , he caught my eye , as he was coming out . Did n't say a word . We just looked at each other and I knew . Plain little guy , plain clothes , no pride in him , humble . He looked at me and got into a pedicab . I knew . Went upstairs and Johnny was sitting in a chair by the window , with his mouth a little open , like he 'd just thought of something to say . "
67158	67172	67173	67173	She	2019	" Never much found anybody I gave a damn about , after that . "
67484	67493	67494	67494	she	2019	" Guess you 're kinda like he was , "
67497	67543	67494	67494	she	2019	" Think you 're born to run . Figure what you were into back in Chiba , that was a stripped down version of what you 'd be doing anywhere . Bad luck , it 'll do that sometimes , get you down to basics . "
67552	67592	67593	67593	She	2019	" You know , I figure the one Tessier - Ashpool sent after that Jimmy , the boy who stole the head , he must be pretty much the same as the one the Yak sent to kill Johnny . "
67986	67991	67992	67992	she	2019	" He told me , "
67995	68082	67992	67992	she	2019	" Wintermute . How he played a waiting game for years . Did n't have any real power , then , but he could use the Villa 's security and custodial systems to keep track of where everything was , how things moved , where they went . He saw somebody lose this key twenty years ago , and he managed to get somebody else to leave it here . Then he killed him , the boy who 'd brought it here . Kid was eight . "
68092	68099	68083	68083	She	2019	" So nobody would find it . "
68134	68188	68127	68127	she	2019	" They were always fucking him over with how old - fashioned they were , he said , all their nineteenth - century stuff . He looked just like the Finn , on the screen in that meat puppet hole . Almost thought he was the Finn , if I was n't careful . "
68203	68254	68255	68255	She	2019	" He said if they 'd turned into what they 'd wanted to , he could 've gotten out a long time ago . But they did n't . Screwed up . Freaks like 3Jane . That 's what he called her , but he talked like he liked her . "
68287	68296	68255	68255	She	2019	" Dixie , you think this thing'll work ? "
68297	68306	68255	68255	She	2019	" Does a bear shit in the woods ? "
68440	68446	68447	68448	the construct	1266	" That 's the sting , "
68451	68472	68447	68448	the construct	1266	" When Kuang 's good and bellytight with the Tessier - Ashpool core , we 're ridin ' that through . "
68473	68504	68505	68505	he	274	" You were right , Dix . There 's some kind of manual override on the hardwiring that keeps Wintermute under control . How- ever much he is under control , "
68508	68511	68512	68513	the construct	1266	" He , "
68516	68529	68512	68513	the construct	1266	" He . Watch that . It . I keep telling you . "
68530	68570	68447	68448	the construct	1266	" It 's a code . A word , he said . Somebody has to speak it into a fancy terminal in a certain room , while we take care of whatever 's waiting for us behind that ice . "
68571	68582	68583	68584	the Flatline	1259	" Well , you got time to kill , kid , "
68587	68595	68583	68584	the Flatline	1259	" Ol' Kuang 's slow but steady . "
68605	68612	68601	68601	Maelcum	409	" You dead awhile there mon . "
68613	68617	68618	68618	he	274	" It happens , "
68621	68629	68618	68618	he	274	" i 'm getting used to it . "
68630	68642	68601	68601	Maelcum	409	" You dealin ' wi ' th ' darkness , mon . "
68643	68653	68601	68601	Maelcum	409	" Only game in town , it looks like . "
68654	68660	68661	68661	Maelcum	409	" Jah love , Case , "
68848	68855	68845	68845	She	437	" Lemme look around , okay ? "
68858	68865	68866	68866	She	437	" Relax . There 's time . "
69012	69017	69040	69041	the fletcher	818	" What 's this , "
69023	69027	69040	69041	the fletcher	818	" fancy dress ? "
69047	69055	69056	69056	She	437	" Come visit , child . Now . "
69170	69175	69163	69163	He	638	" Slow , darling . "
69291	69297	69298	69300	the old man	1579	" It would be customary , "
69303	69311	69298	69300	the old man	1579	" for me to kill you now . "
69322	69334	69314	69314	her	437	" But tonight I indulge myself . What is your name ? "
69335	69338	69298	69300	the old man	1579	" Molly . "
69339	69346	69347	69347	He	1579	" Molly . Mine is Ashpool . "
69424	69444	69445	69445	His	1579	" How do you cry , Molly ? I see your eyes are walled away . I 'm curious . "
69471	69479	69465	69465	Case	274	" I do n't cry , much . "
69480	69493	69465	69465	Case	274	" But how would you cry , if someone made you cry ? "
69494	69498	69499	69499	she	437	" I spit , "
69502	69512	69499	69499	she	437	" The ducts are routed back into my mouth . "
69513	69528	69529	69529	He	1579	" Then you 've already learned an important lesson , for one so young . "
69579	69588	69589	69589	He	1579	" That is the way to handle tears . "
69593	69614	69589	69589	He	1579	" I 'm busy tonight , Molly . I built all this , and now I 'm busy . Dying . "
69615	69625	69626	69626	she	437	" I could go out the way I came , "
69637	69660	69629	69629	He	1579	" You intrude on my suicide and then ask to simply walk out ? Really , you amaze me . A thief . "
69661	69688	69629	69629	He	1579	" It 's my ass , boss , and it 's all I got . I just wanna get it out of here in one piece . "
69689	69739	69740	69740	He	1579	" You are a very rude girl . Suicides here are conducted with a degree of decorum . That 's what I 'm doing , you understand . But perhaps I 'll take you with me tonight , down to hell .... It would be very Egyptian of me . "
69744	69749	69740	69740	He	1579	" Come here then . "
69760	69763	69750	69750	He	1579	" Drink . "
69769	69775	69776	69776	he	1579	" It is n't poisoned , "
69787	69799	69776	69776	he	1579	" Sit . Sit on the floor . We 'll talk . "
69800	69804	69805	69805	She	2067	" What about ? "
69821	70049	69808	69808	Case	274	" Whatever comes to mind . My mind . It 's my party . The cores woke me . Twenty hours ago . Something was afoot , they said , and l was needed . Were you the something , Molly ? Surely they did n't need me to handle you , no . Something else . . . but I 'd been dreaming , you see . For thirty years . You were n't born , when last I lay me down to sleep . They told us we would n't dream , in that cold . They told us we 'd never feel cold , either . Madness , Molly . Lies . Of course I dreamed . The cold let the outside in , that was it . The outside . All the night I built this to hide us from . Just a drop , at first , one grain of night seeping in , drawn by the cold . . . Others following it , filling my head the way rain fills an empty pool . Calla lilies . I remember . The pools were terracotta , nursemaids all of chrome , how the limbs went winking through the gardens at sunset .... I 'm old , Molly . Over two hundred years , if you count the cold . The cold . "
70074	70080	70081	70081	she	2068	" You can get freezerburn , "
70085	70090	70091	70091	he	2069	" Nothing burns there , "
70119	70198	70106	70106	His	2069	" Nothing burns . I remember now . The cores told me our intelligences are mad . And all the billions we paid , so long ago . When artificial intelligences were rather a racy concept . I told the cores I 'd deal with it . Bad timing , really , with 8Jean down in Melbourne and only our sweet 3Jane minding the store . Or very good timing , perhaps . Would you know , Molly ? "
70204	70218	70106	70106	His	2069	" There are some odd things afoot now , in the Villa Straylight . "
70219	70222	70223	70223	she	2068	" Boss , "

70233	70289	70290	70290	He	2069	" A name . Yes . To conjure with , perhaps . A lord of hell , surely . In my time , dear Molly , I have known many lords . And not a few ladies . Why , a queen of Spain , once , in that very bed .... But I wander . "
70315	70358	70304	70304	He	2069	" How I do wander . Through the cold . But soon no more . I 'd ordered a Jane thawed , when I woke . Strange , to lie every few decades with what legally amounts to one 's own daughter . "
70377	70384	70385	70385	he	2069	" Marie - France 's eyes , "

70880	70887	70888	70889	the Flatline	1259	" Got your boss on hold , "
70892	70920	70888	70889	the Flatline	1259	" He 's coming through on the twin Hosaka in that boat upstairs , the one that 's riding us piggy - back . Called the Haniwa . "

71155	71159	71107	71107	Armitage	312	" General who ? "
71165	71178	71179	71179	he	274	" Run that back and get the Hosaka to look it up , "

71657	71770	71771	71771	She	2099	" How you doin' , Case ? You back in Garvey with Maelcum ? Sure . And jacked into this . I like it , you know ? Like I 've always talked to myself , in my head , when I 've been in tight spots . Pretend I got some friend , somebody I can trust , and I 'll tell 'em what I really think , what I feel like , and then I 'll pretend they 're telling me what they think about that , and I 'll just go along that way . Having you in is kinda like that . That scene with Ashpool . . . "
71789	71847	71771	71771	She	2099	" I was expecting something maybe a little less gone , you know ? I mean , these guys are all batshit in here , like they got luminous messages scrawled across the inside of their foreheads or something . I do n't like the way it looks , I do n't like the way it smells .... "
71871	71924	71925	71925	She	2099	" And while I 'm feeling confessional , baby , I got ta admit maybe I never much expected to make it out of this one anyway . Been on this bad roll for a while , and you 're the only good change come down since I signed on with Armitage . "

But your pal Wintermute put me on to somethin' there before it went black . The reason Straylight 's not exactly hop- pin ' with Tessier - Ashpools is that they 're mostly in cold sleep . There 's a law firm in London keeps track of their powers of attorney . Has to know who 's awake and exactly when . Ar- mitage was routing the transmissions from London to Straylight through the Hosaka on the yacht . Incidently , they know the old man 's dead . "
73249	73253	73084	73084	Case	274	" Who knows ? "
73254	73566	73136	73137	the Flatline	1259	" The law firm and T - A. He had a medical remote planted in his sternum . Not that your girl 's dart would 've left a res- urrection crew with much to work with . Shellfish toxin . But the only T - A awake in Straylight right now is Lady 3Jane Marie - France . There 's a male , couple years older , in Australia on business . You ask me , I bet Wintermute found a way to cause that business to need this 8Jean 's personal attention . But he 's on his way home , or near as matters . The London lawyers give his Straylight ETA as 09:00:00 , tonight . We slotted Kuang virus at 02:32:03 . It 's 04:45:20 . Best estimate for Kuang pen- etration of the T - A core is 08:30:00 . Or a hair on either side . I figure Wintermute 's got somethin' goin' with this 3Jane , or else she 's just as crazy as her old man was . But the boy up from Melbourne'll know the score . The Straylight security sys- tems keep trying to go full alert , but Wintermute blocks 'em , do n't ask me how . Could n't override the basic gate program to get Molly in , though . Armitage had a record of all that on his Hosaka ; Riviera must 've talked 3Jane into doing it . She 's been able to fiddle entrances and exits for years . Looks to me like one of T - A 's main problems is that every family bigwig has riddled the banks with all kinds of private scams and ex- ceptions . Kinda like your immune system falling apart on you . Ripe for virus . Looks good for us , once we 're past that ice . "

You 'll take Garvey into a very private dock I 'll show you . The Chinese virus has com- pletely penetrated the fabric of the Hosaka . There 's nothing in the Hosaka but virus now . When you dock , the virus will be interfaced with the Straylight custodial system and we 'll cut the sideband . You 'll take your deck , the Flatline , and Maelcum . You 'll find 3Jane , get the word out of her , kill Riviera , get the key from Molly . You can keep track of the program by jacking your deck into the Straylight system . I 'll handle it for you . There 's a standard jack in the back of the head , behind a panel with five zircons . "

82541	82581	82582	82583	The Finn	329	" You fucked up . You blew the controls on the grapples when you blew Armitage . Haniwa 's got us good and tight . Armitage fried the other Hosaka and the mainframes went with the bridge , right ? "

83138	83163	83135	83135	Molly	437	" I would 've killed him . I 'd 've tried to kill the ninja . Then I was supposed to talk with you . "
83164	83167	83229	83229	she	1266	" Why ? "
83184	83192	83193	83193	Molly	437	" And why ? And what about ? "
83222	83228	83229	83229	she	1266	" Because I hate him , "
83234	83256	83229	83229	she	1266	" and the why of that 's just the way I 'm wired , what he is and what I am . "

83281	83300	83229	83229	she	1266	" Because they 're the best . Because one of them killed a partner of mine , once . "
83311	83318	83319	83319	Molly	437	" Because I had to see , "
83322	83337	83319	83319	Molly	437	" And then we would have talked , you and I ? Like this ? "
83358	83364	83338	83338	Her	1266	" Shall we talk now ? "
83365	83370	83371	83371	Molly	437	" Take this off , "

83426	83434	83435	83435	she	1266	" He was fond of broad gestures , "
83465	83488	83489	83489	He	393	" Getting acquainted ? She 's an interesting girl , is n't she ? I thought so when I first saw her . "

83519	83537	83538	83538	He	393	" Wintermute wo n't be the first to have made the same mis- take . Underestimating me . "
83560	83638	83639	83639	He	393	" He talked with me , Molly . I suppose he talked to all of us . You , and Case , whatever there is of Armitage to talk to . He ca n't really understand us , you know . He has his profiles , but those are only statistics . You may be the statistical animal , darling , and Case is nothing but , but I possess a quality unquantifiable by its very nature . "
83642	83651	83652	83652	Molly	437	" And what exactly is that , Peter ? "
83662	83665	83666	83666	He	393	" Perversity . "
83700	83722	83723	83723	She	437	" An enjoyment of the gratuitous act . And I have made a decision , Molly , a wholly gratuitous decision . "

83751	83798	83799	83799	He	393	" No word for you , Molly . He told me about that you see . 3Jane knows the code , of course , but you wo n't have it . Neither will Wintermute . My Jane 's an ambitious girl , in her perverse way . "
83803	83883	83884	83884	He	393	" She has designs on the family empire , and a pair of insane artificial intelligences , kinky as the concept may be , would only get in our way . So . Comes her Riviera to help her out , you see . And Peter says , sit tight . Play Daddy 's favorite swing records and let Peter call you up a band to match , a floor of dancers , a wake for dead King Ashpool . "
83894	83916	83884	83884	He	393	" No , you would n't do , Daddy , you would not do . Now that Peter 's come home . "

84781	84812	84775	84775	Riviera	393	" About my mother . She asked me to . I think she was in shock , aside from Hideo 's injection . Why did you do that to her ? "

She imagined us in a symbiotic relationship with the Al 's , our corporate decisions made for us . Our conscious decisions , I should say . Tessier- Ashpool would be immortal , a hive , each of us units of a larger entity . Fascinating . I 'll play her tapes for you , nearly a thousand hours . But I 've never understood her , really , and with her death , her direction was lost . All direction was lost , and we began to burrow into ourselves . Now we seldom come out . I 'm the exception there . "

As clear to me as the shadow of a tumor to a surgeon studying a patient 's scan . When she took your Hitachi to her boy , to try to access it -- she had no idea what it carried , still less how she might sell it , and her deepest wish was that you would pursue and punish her -- I intervened .

You won when you walked away from her on the beach . She was my last line of defense . I die soon , in one sense . As does Wintermute . As surely as Riviera does , now , as he lies paralyzed beside the stump of a wall in the apartments of my Lady 3Jane Marie - France , his nigra - striatal system un- able to produce the dopamine receptors that could save him from Hideo 's arrow .
