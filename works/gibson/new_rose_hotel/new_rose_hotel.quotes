3067	4184	4189	4189	he	188	'm Dutch now , you said , I 'll want a new look . Dr Hiroshi Yomiuri went missing in Vienna , in a quiet street off Singerstrasse , two blocks from his wife 's favorite hotel . On a clear afternoon in October , in the presence of a dozen expert witnesses , Dr Yomiuri vanished . He stepped through a looking glass . Somewhere , offstage , the oiled play of Victorian clockwork . I sat in a hotel room in Geneva and took the Welshman 's call . It was done , Hiroshi down my rabbit hole and headed for Marrakech . I poured myself a drink and thought about your legs . Fox and I met in Narita a day later , in a sushi bar in the . JAL terminal . He 'd just stepped off an Air Maroc jet , exhausted and triumphant . Loves it there , he said , meaning Hiroshi . Loves her , he said , meaning you . I smiled . You 'd promised to meet me in Shinjuku in a month . Your cheap little gun in the New Rose Hotel . Ale chrome is starting to peel . The machining is clumsy , blurry Chinese stamped into rough steel . The grips are red plastic , molded with a dragon on either side . Like a child 's toy . Fox ate sushi in the JAL terminal , high on what we 'd done . The shoulder had been giving him trouble , but he said he did n't care . Money now for better doctors . Money now for everything . Somehow it did n't seem very important to me , the money we 'd gotten from Hosaka . Not that I doubted our new wealth , but that last night with you had left me convinced that it all came to us naturally , in the new order of things , as a function of who and what we were . Poor Fox . With his blue oxford shirts crisper than ever , his Paris suits darker and richer . Sitting there in JAL , dabbing sushi into a little rectangular tray of green horseradish , he had less than a week to live . Dark now , and the coffin racks of New Rose are lit all night by floodlights , high on painted metal masts . Nothing here seems to serve its original purpose . Everything is surplus , recycled , even the coffins . Forty years ago these plastic capsules were stacked in Tokyo or Yokohama , a modern convenience for traveling businessmen . Maybe your father slept in one . When the scaffolding was new , it rose around the shell of some mirrored tower on the Ginza , swarmed over by crews of builders . The breeze tonight brings the rattle of a pachinko parlor , the smell of stewed vegetables from the pushcarts across the road . I spread crab - flavored krill paste on orange rice crackers . I can hear the planes . Those last few days in Tokyo , Fox and I had adjoining suites on the fifty - third floor of the Hyatt . No contact with Hosaka . They paid us , then erased us from official corporate memory . I But Fox could n't let go . Hiroshi was his baby , his pet project . He 'd developed a proprietary , almost fatherly , interest in Hiroshi . He loved him for his Edge . So Fox had me keep in touch with my Portuguese businessman in the Medina , who was willing to keep a very partial eye on Hiroshi 's lab for us . When he phoned , he 'd phone from a stall in Djemaa - el - Fna , with a background of wailing vendors and Atlas panpipes . Someone was moving security into Marrakech , he told us . Fox nodded . Hosaka . After less than a dozen calls , I saw the change in Fox , a tension , a look of abstraction . I 'd find him at the window , staring down fifty - three floors into the Imperial gardens , lost in something he would n't talk about . Ask him for a more detailed description , he , said , after one particular call . He thought a man our contact had seen entering Hiroshi 's lab might be Moenner , Hosaka 's leading gene man . That was Moenner , he said , after the next call . Another call and he thought he 'd identified Chedanne , who headed Hosaka 's protein team . Neither had been seen outside the corporate arcology in over two years . By then it was obvious that Hosaka 's leading researchers were pooling quietly in the Medina , the black executive Lears whispering into the Marrakech airport on carbon - fiber wings . Fox shook his head . He was a professional , a specialist , and he saw the sudden accumulation of all that prime Hosaka Edge in the Medina as a drastic failure in the zaibatsu 's tradecraft . Christ , he said , pouring himself a Black Label , they 've got their whole bio section in there right now . One bomb . He shook his head . One grenade in the right place at the right time ... I reminded him of the saturation techniques Hosaka security was obviously employing . Hosaka had lines to the heart of the Diet , and their massive infiltration of agents into Marrakech could only be taking place with the knowledge and cooperation of the Moroccan government . Hang it up . I said . It 's over . You 've sold them Hiroshi . Now forget him . I know what it is , he said . I know . I saw it once before . He said that there was a certain wild factor in lab work . The edge of Edge , he called it . When a researcher develops a breakthrough , others sometimes find it impossible to duplicate the first researcher 's results . This was even more likely with Hiroshi , whose work went against the conceptual grain of his field . The answer , often , was to fly the breakthrough boy from lab to corporate lab for a ritual laying on of hands . A few pointless adjustments in the equipment , and the process would work . Crazy thing , he said , nobody knows why it works that way , but it does . He grinned . But they 're
4279	5084	4275	4275	he	188	're right , it 's over . I did go to bed , but the phone woke me . Marrakech again , the white static of a satellite link , a rush of frightened Portuguese . Hosaka did n't freeze our credit , they caused it to evaporate . Fairy gold . One minute we were millionaires in the world 's hardest currency , and the next we were paupers . I woke Fox . Sandii , he said . She sold out . Maas security turned her in Vienna . Sweet Jesus . I watched him slit his battered suitcase apart with a Swiss Army knife . He had three gold bars glued in there with contact cement . Soft plates , each one proofed and stamped by the treasury of some extinct African government . I should 've seen it , he said , his voice flat . I said no . I think I said your name . Forget her , he said . Hosaka wants us dead . They 'll assume we crossed them . Get on the phone and check our credit . Our credit was gone . They denied that either of us had ever had an account . Haul ass , Fox said . We ran . Out a service door , into Tokyo traffic , and down into Shinjuku . That was when I understood for the first time the real extent of Hosaka 's reach . Every door was closed . People we 'd done business with for two years saw us coming , and I 'd see steel shutters slam behind their eyes . We 'd get out before they had a chance to reach for the phone . The surface tension of the underworld had been tripled , and everywhere we 'd meet that same taut membrane and be thrown back . No chance to sink , to get out of sight . Hosaka let us run for most of that first day . Then they sent someone to break Fox 's back a second time . I did n't see them do it , but I saw him fall . We were in a Ginza department store an hour before closing , and I saw his arc off that polished mezzanine , down into all the wares of the new Asia . They missed me somehow , and I just kept running . Fox took the gold with him , but I had a hundred new yen in my pocket . I ran . All the way to the New Rose Hotel . Now it 's time . Come with me , Sandii . Hear the neon humming on the road to Narita International . A few late moths trace stopmotion circles around the floodlights that shine on New Rose . And the funny thing , Sandii , is how sometimes you just do n't seem real to me . Fox once said you were ectoplasm , a ghost called up by the extremes of economics . Ghost of the new century , congealing on a thousand beds in the world 's Hyatts , the world 's Hiltons . Now I 've got your gun in my hand , jacket pocket , and my hand seems so far away . Disconnected . I remember my Portuguese business friend forgetting his English , trying to get it across in four languages I barely understood , and I thought he was telling me that the Medina was burning . Not the Medina . The brains of Hosaka 's best research people . Plague , he was whispering , my businessman , plague and fever and death . Smart Fox , he put it together on the run . I did n't even have to mention finding the diskette in your bag in Germany . Someone had reprogrammed the DNA synthesizer , he said . The thing was there for the overnight construction of just the right macromolecule . With its in - built computer and its custom software . Expensive , Sandii . But not as expensive as you turned out to be for Hosaka . I hope you got a good price from Maas . The diskette in my hand . Rain on the river . I knew , but I could n't face it . I put the code for that meningial virus back into your purse and lay down beside you . So Moenner died , along with other Hosaka researchers . Including Hiroshi . Chedanne suffered permanent brain damage . Hiroshi had n't worried about contamination . The proteins he punched for were harmless . So the synthesizer hummed to itself all night long building a virus to the specifications of Maas Biolabs GmbH. Maas . Small , fast , ruthless '
